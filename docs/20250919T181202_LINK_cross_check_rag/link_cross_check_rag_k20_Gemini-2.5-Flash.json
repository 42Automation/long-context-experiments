  "expected_answer": "Yes, there are discrepancies. In particular, the revenue per segment for Central Europe in 2019 is 596,805K NOK in the annual report and 639,486K NOK in the prospectus, which also causes the totals to differ with 2,890,025K NOK in the annual report and 2,932,707K NOK in the prospectus.",
  "output": "Yes, there are discrepancies in the reported revenue values for 2019.\n\n**Revenue:**\n*   **2019:**\n    *   **Prospectus (Excerpt 1):** NOK 2,932.7 million\n    *   **Annual Report (Excerpt 1):** NOK 2,890,025 thousand (NOK 2,890.025 million)\n    *   **Discrepancy:** The prospectus reports a higher revenue for 2019 by approximately NOK 42.675 million compared to the annual report.\n\n*   **2020:**\n    *   **Prospectus (Excerpt 4):** Forecasted revenue range of NOK 3,500 - 3,600 million.\n    *   **Annual Report (Excerpt 1):** Reported revenue of NOK 3,539,231 thousand (NOK 3,539.231 million).\n    *   The actual 2020 revenue falls within the forecasted range provided in the prospectus.\n\n**Gross Profit:**\n*   The prospectus (Excerpt 0) defines \"Gross Profit\" but does not provide specific historical values for 2019 or 2020 in the provided excerpts. It only forecasts a \"Gross Margin\" for 2020.\n*   The annual report (Excerpt 1) provides the components to calculate Gross Profit (Revenue less Direct cost of services rendered).\n    *   **2020 Gross Profit:** 3,539,231 - 2,640,012 = 899,219 NOK thousand\n    *   **2019 Gross Profit:** 2,890,025 - 2,137,125 = 752,900 NOK thousand\n*   **Gross Margin for 2020:**\n    *   **Prospectus (Excerpt 4):** Forecasted range of 24.2% - 24.7%.\n    *   **Annual Report (calculated):** (899,219 / 3,539,231) \\* 100 = 25.41%.\n    *   The actual 2020 Gross Margin is slightly above the forecasted range.\n\nTherefore, a direct comparison of \"Gross Profit\" values between the two documents is not possible from the provided excerpts, but the 2020 actual Gross Margin is higher than the prospectus forecast.",
