  "expected_answer": "Yes, there are discrepancies. In particular, the revenue per segment for Central Europe in 2019 is 596,805K NOK in the annual report and 639,486K NOK in the prospectus, which also causes the totals to differ with 2,890,025K NOK in the annual report and 2,932,707K NOK in the prospectus.",
  "output": "Yes.\n\n- Revenue (year ended 31 Dec 2019):\n  - Prospectus (excerpt_1 / 10.2): Total operating revenue for year ended 31 Dec 2019 = NOK 2,932,707 thousand.\n  - Annual Report 2020 (excerpt_0 / Consolidated income statement): Revenue for 2020 = NOK 3,539,231 thousand and for 2019 = NOK 2,890,025 thousand.\n  - Discrepancy: The prospectus reports 2019 revenue as NOK 2,932,707k, while the annual report reports 2019 revenue as NOK 2,890,025k \u2014 a difference of NOK 42,682k.\n\n- Gross profit / Gross margin:\n  - Prospectus states Gross Margin for year ended 31 Dec 2018 was 28% (excerpt_5) and gives segment margins for 2018 and 2017; it also reports cost of services rendered and revenue for various periods (excerpt_1: for year 2019 cost of services rendered = -2,179,806 and revenue = 2,932,707 per prospectus, implying gross profit 753, (i.e., 2,932,707 - 2,179,806 = NOK 752,901k) and gross margin \u224825.7%).\n  - Annual Report 2020 provides: for year 2019 total operating revenue = NOK 2,890,025k and direct cost of services rendered = NOK -2,137,125k (excerpt_0), implying gross profit = NOK 752,900k and gross margin \u224826.1%.\n  - Discrepancy: The absolute gross profit amount for 2019 is essentially the same (\u2248NOK 752.9m) because the annual-report 2019 figures (2,890,025 \u2212 2,137,125 = 752,900) are in line with the prospectus implied gross profit (2,932,707 \u2212 2,179,806 = 752,901). The small differences in revenue and cost entries offset so gross profit is effectively the same, though reported revenue and cost of services differ between the documents.\n\nSummary: There is a clear discrepancy in reported 2019 total revenue between the prospectus (NOK 2,932,707k) and the annual report (NOK 2,890,025k) (difference NOK 42,682k). Gross profit for 2019 is effectively consistent between the two (both ~NOK 752.9m) because the differing revenue and cost of services figures offset.",
