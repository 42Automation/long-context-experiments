  "expected_answer": "Yes, there are discrepancies. In particular, the revenue per segment for Central Europe in 2019 is 596,805K NOK in the annual report and 639,486K NOK in the prospectus, which also causes the totals to differ with 2,890,025K NOK in the annual report and 2,932,707K NOK in the prospectus.",
  "output": "Yes. There are discrepancies in the presented revenue and gross profit figures between the Prospectus (as of mid\u20112020 data) and the 2020 Annual Report:\n\n- Full year 2020 revenue:\n  - Annual Report 2020: Revenue = NOK 3,539.2 million (Consolidated income statement).\n  - Prospectus 2020 outlook (forecast) gave a 2020 revenue range of NOK 3,500\u20133,600 million (this is a forecast, not actual). So the Annual Report actual falls within the Prospectus forecast \u2014 no substantive conflict there.\n\n- Reported historical/reported periods (comparable figures):\n  - Prospectus (Condensed statements / Non\u2011IFRS tables) shows revenue for year ended 31 Dec 2019 as NOK 2,932.7 million (Prospectus excerpts 10.2, 10.6, 10.7).\n  - Annual Report restated 2019 revenue as NOK 2,890.0 million (Consolidated income statement excerpt_0). That is a difference of NOK ~42.7 million (Prospectus higher).\n  - For six months ended 30 June 2020, both documents show revenue ~NOK 1,717.6 million (Prospectus excerpt_2 and excerpt_14) and Annual Report\u2019s segmentation/disclosures are consistent with full\u2011year totals \u2014 no material mismatch for the H1 2020 number.\n\n- Gross profit / Gross margin:\n  - Prospectus (non\u2011IFRS) for full year 2019: Gross Profit = NOK 752.9 million; Gross Margin = 26% (excerpt_3/10.7.1).\n  - Annual Report 2019 does not explicitly list a single \"Gross Profit\" line in the primary statement but the Annual Report 2019 income statement (excerpt_0) shows:\n    - Total operating revenue 2019 = NOK 2,890.0 million\n    - Direct cost of services rendered = NOK 2,640.0 million (full year 2020 numbers are shown; Annual Report does not give a clear 2019 direct cost line in excerpts provided). However, Prospectus 2019 direct costs implied: revenue 2,932.7 \u2013 gross profit 752.9 = direct costs ~2,179.8 (which matches Prospectus 2019 direct cost in excerpt_2). The Annual Report\u2019s 2019 revenue (2,890.0) vs Prospectus 2019 revenue (2,932.7) explains most of the gross profit difference.\n  - For 2020, Prospectus non\u2011IFRS LTM and H1 metrics show Gross Profit for six months ended 30 June 2020 = NOK 429.3 million (Gross Margin 25%). Annual Report 2020 shows full\u2011year Loss and provides gross\u2011profit\u2011related items (revenue 3,539.2; direct cost of services rendered 2,640.0), implying full\u2011year gross profit = 899.2 million (3,539.2 \u2212 2,640.0). Prospectus did not give a full\u2011year 2020 reported gross profit number (only H1 and forecasts for margins 24.2\u201324.7%), so no direct contradiction.\n\nSummary: The main discrepancy is that the Prospectus reports 2019 revenue as NOK 2,932.7m and Gross Profit 752.9m, whereas the Annual Report shows 2019 revenue restated/compiled as NOK 2,890.0m (a ~NOK 42.7m difference). This difference flows through to related gross\u2011profit calculations. The 2020 full\u2011year actual revenue in the Annual Report (NOK 3,539.2m) is within the Prospectus forecast range (NOK 3,500\u20133,600m), and H1 2020 figures are consistent across documents.",
