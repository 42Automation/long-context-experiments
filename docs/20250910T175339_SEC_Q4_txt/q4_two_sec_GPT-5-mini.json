  "expected_answer": "Vesting is contingent upon the achievement of specific company performance metrics. In this case, it's tied to Apple's relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) percentile performance compared to a defined group of peer companies over a predetermined performance period.",
  "output": "Under Apple\u2019s 2022 Employee Stock Plan, vesting for performance-based restricted stock unit awards is determined by the specific performance metrics and performance period set in the award\u2019s terms (the Grant Notice and Exhibit A to the award agreement).\n\nKey points:\n\n- Each performance award specifies a performance metric (for example, Apple\u2019s relative total shareholder return \u2014 \u201cTSR\u201d \u2014 versus a comparison group) and a defined performance period.\n- The percentage of the target award that vests depends on how the company achieves those metric targets over the performance period. Award documents list threshold, target and maximum payout levels (e.g., vesting at 0% below a threshold, 100% at target, more at maximum), and payouts for intermediate results are typically determined by straight\u2011line interpolation between those levels.\n- If the award ties vesting to a TSR percentile, the Company\u2019s percentile rank against the stated comparison group over the performance period determines the vesting percentage (with rules for tie-breaking and treatment of delisted or bankrupt companies).\n- Vesting is subject to continued employment/service requirements unless otherwise provided (e.g., accelerated or prorated vesting upon death, Disability, Retirement, or other specified termination events).\n- Dividend equivalent rights (if any) associated with the RSUs are payable or credited subject to the same vesting/performance outcomes.\n- Final determinations (including adjustments for corporate events such as stock splits, or interpretation of the metric and payout) are made by the Committee per the award agreement.\n\nIf you want, I can summarize the exact TSR percentiles and payout table shown in the Exhibit A examples from the Form 10\u2011K.",
