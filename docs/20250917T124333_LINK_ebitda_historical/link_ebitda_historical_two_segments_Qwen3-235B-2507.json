  "expected_answer": "The data in the documents provided allows us to compare historical adjusted EBITDA data for 2019 (previous years are not documented in the yearly report and 2020 is partially forecasted in the prospectus). For 2019, there are slight variations in adjusted EBITDA values reported. It can be found reported as 307,941 NOKK, or as 307,549 NOKK or as 307.5 NOKM or as 307,548 NOKK. So the values don't fully match, though they are all within 307.5 and 307.9 NOKM.",
  "output": "The **historical Adjusted EBITDA** values between the **IPO prospectus** and the **Annual Report 2020** **do not fully match**, and there are **notable discrepancies**, particularly for the full year 2019.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Comparison of Adjusted EBITDA (Full Year 2019)**\n\n| Source | Adjusted EBITDA (2019) | Value |\n|-------|------------------------|-------|\n| **IPO Prospectus** | From Section 10.7.1 and 10.7.2 | **NOK 307.5 million** (i.e., 307,500,000) |\n| **Annual Report 2020** | Reconciliation on p. 82 | **NOK 307,549,000** (~307.5 million) |\n\n\u2705 **Conclusion for 2019**: The values **essentially match** (difference of ~NOK 49,000 is negligible and likely due to rounding).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Comparison of Adjusted EBITDA (Year-to-Date 2020 / H1 2020)**\n\n| Source | Adjusted EBITDA (H1 2020) | Value |\n|-------|----------------------------|-------|\n| **IPO Prospectus** | Section 10.7.1 and 10.7.2 | **NOK 182.6 million** (182,600,000) |\n| **Prospectus \u2013 Later Table (p. 78)** | Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to EBIT | **NOK 182,692,000** |\n| **Annual Report 2020** | Full-year reconciliation (p. 82) | **NOK 390,841,000** for **full year 2020** |\n\nNow, check if H1 2020 in the prospectus aligns with **H1 2020 in the annual report**.\n\nBut the **annual report only provides full-year 2020** data, not a breakdown for H1 2020.\n\nHowever, we can infer:\n\n- **Prospectus (H1 2020)**: Adjusted EBITDA = **182.6 million**\n- **Annual Report (Full Year 2020)**: Adjusted EBITDA = **390.8 million**\n\n\u2192 This implies **H2 2020 Adjusted EBITDA** = 390.8 \u2013 182.6 \u2248 **208.2 million**\n\nThis is **plausible** (higher in H2), so **no contradiction**.\n\nBut note: In the **prospectus reconciliation on p. 78**, the Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2020 is **182,692,000**, while the summary table says **182.6 million** \u2014 this is consistent (rounded).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Adjusted EBITDA by Segment \u2013 Full Year 2019**\n\n| Segment | Prospectus (10.7.2) | Annual Report (p. 23) | Match? |\n|--------|---------------------|------------------------|-------|\n| Nordics | 194,266 | 194,266 | \u2705 Yes |\n| Central Europe | 101,021 | 101,021 | \u2705 Yes |\n| Western Europe | 83,834 | 83,834 | \u2705 Yes |\n| Global Messaging | 26,603 | 26,603 | \u2705 Yes |\n| Group Costs | -98,176 | -97,783 | \u274c No (differs by ~393,000) |\n| **Total** | **307,548** | **307,941** | \u274c Slight mismatch (~393,000) |\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Note**: The **total Adjusted EBITDA** in the segment table in the prospectus is **307,548,000**, but in the annual report, it's **307,549,000** \u2014 very close, likely rounding.\n\nBut the **Group Costs** line differs by **393,000**, which explains the small total mismatch.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Full Year 2020 \u2013 Annual Report vs Prospectus**\n\nThe **prospectus** does **not contain full-year 2020** data (it was published earlier).\n\nThe **annual report 2020** reports:\n- **Adjusted EBITDA 2020**: **NOK 390.8 million**\n- **Adjusted EBITDA Margin**: **11.0%**\n\nThis is **not contradicted** by the prospectus, as the prospectus only goes up to H1 2020.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Conclusion:\n\n| Aspect | Match? | Notes |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| **Full Year 2019 Adjusted EBITDA (Group Total)** | \u2705 **Yes** | 307.5 million in both (minor rounding differences) |\n| **H1 2020 Adjusted EBITDA (Group Total)** | \u2705 **Yes (rounded)** | Prospectus: 182.6M; detailed table: 182.692M |\n| **Adjusted EBITDA by Segment (2019)** | \u26a0\ufe0f **Mostly, except Group Costs** | Group Costs differ by ~393,000; likely due to reclassification or rounding |\n| **Full Year 2020 Adjusted EBITDA** | N/A | Not in prospectus; annual report value is standalone |\n| **Overall Consistency** | \u2705 **Largely consistent** | Differences are minor and likely due to rounding, reclassification, or final audit adjustments |\n\n> \u2705 **Bottom Line**: The **core Adjusted EBITDA figures are consistent** between the IPO prospectus and the annual report, with **minor discrepancies in segment-level Group Costs**, which do not materially affect the overall financial picture.",
