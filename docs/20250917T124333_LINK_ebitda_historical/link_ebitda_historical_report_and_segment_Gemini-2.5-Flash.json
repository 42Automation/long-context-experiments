  "expected_answer": "The data in the documents provided allows us to compare historical adjusted EBITDA data for 2019 (previous years are not documented in the yearly report and 2020 is partially forecasted in the prospectus). For 2019, there are slight variations in adjusted EBITDA values reported. It can be found reported as 307,941 NOKK, or as 307,549 NOKK or as 307.5 NOKM or as 307,548 NOKK. So the values don't fully match, though they are all within 307.5 and 307.9 NOKM.",
  "output": "Based on the provided documents:\n\n*   **For 2019:**\n    *   IPO Prospectus (Section 10.7.1): **NOK 307.5 million**\n    *   Annual Report (Reconciliation table): **NOK 307,549 thousand** (which is NOK 307.549 million)\n\nThese values are consistent, with the minor difference likely due to rounding in the IPO Prospectus.\n\n*   **For 2018:**\n    *   IPO Prospectus (Section 10.7.1): **NOK 212.0 million**\n    *   The provided snippets from the Annual Report do not contain the Adjusted EBITDA value for 2018.",
