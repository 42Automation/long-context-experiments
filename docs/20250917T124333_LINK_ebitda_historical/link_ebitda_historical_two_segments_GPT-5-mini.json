  "expected_answer": "The data in the documents provided allows us to compare historical adjusted EBITDA data for 2019 (previous years are not documented in the yearly report and 2020 is partially forecasted in the prospectus). For 2019, there are slight variations in adjusted EBITDA values reported. It can be found reported as 307,941 NOKK, or as 307,549 NOKK or as 307.5 NOKM or as 307,548 NOKK. So the values don't fully match, though they are all within 307.5 and 307.9 NOKM.",
  "output": "They do not fully match.\n\nFrom the IPO Prospectus (figures in NOK million / thousands as presented there):\n- Six months ended 30 June 2020: Adjusted EBITDA = 182.6 (NOK million) / 182,645 (NOK 1,000)\n- Six months ended 30 June 2019: Adjusted EBITDA = 134.2 / 134,183\n- Year ended 31 December 2019: Adjusted EBITDA = 307.5 / 307,548\n\nFrom the Annual Report 2020 (figures shown in different groupings):\n- Year 2020 (LTM / full year reconciliation): Adjusted EBITDA = 390.841 (NOK million) / 390,841 (presented as 390,842 in one table)\n- Year 2019: Adjusted EBITDA = 307.549 / 307,549 (presented as 307,941 or 307,941 in some tables)\n\nComparison notes:\n- The 2019 year-end Adjusted EBITDA is effectively the same in both documents (around NOK 307.5 million), allowing for rounding and minor presentation differences.\n- The six\u2011month figures for 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2019 in the Prospectus (182.6 and 134.2 million) match the YTD 2020 and YTD 2019 Adjusted EBITDA lines shown elsewhere in the Prospectus and match the Annual Report\u2019s YTD reconciliations (e.g., YTD 2020 = 182,692 / 182,692 shown).\n- However, the Annual Report also presents a full\u2011year 2020 Adjusted EBITDA of ~390.84 million (NOK) which does not appear in the Prospectus\u2019s earlier summary tables (the Prospectus gives LTM Adjusted EBITDA as 356.1 in one reconciliation). Thus there is a discrepancy for the full\u2011year / LTM 2020 figure:\n  - Prospectus LTM Adjusted EBITDA (30 June 2020): 356.1\n  - Annual Report full year / adjusted totals for 2020: ~390.8 (or 390,842) \u2014 higher than the Prospectus LTM number.\n\nIn short: 2019 Adjusted EBITDA figures align (~307.5m). Half\u2011year (YTD) 2020 and 2019 figures in the Prospectus are consistent with its other tables. But the Prospectus LTM Adjusted EBITDA (356.1) differs from the Annual Report\u2019s presented 2020 Adjusted EBITDA (~390.8m), so the full\u2011year/ LTM 2020 numbers do not match between the two documents.",
