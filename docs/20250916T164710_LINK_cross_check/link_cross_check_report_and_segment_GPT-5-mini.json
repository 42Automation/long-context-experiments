  "expected_answer": "Yes, there are discrepancies. In particular, the revenue per segment for Central Europe in 2019 is 596,805K NOK in the annual report and 639,486K NOK in the prospectus, which also causes the totals to differ with 2,890,025K NOK in the annual report and 2,932,707K NOK in the prospectus.",
  "output": "Yes.\n\nComparing the Prospectus (selected financial tables) to the Annual Report excerpt you provided, there are clear discrepancies in the totals for the periods shown (they appear to be different scopes/periods):\n\n- Revenue (Prospectus, six months ended 30 June 2020 / year ended 31 Dec 2019): Prospectus shows 1,717,629 (six months 2020) and 2,932,707 (year 2019).  \n  Annual-report-like appendix shows totals of 3,539,231 (2020) and 2,890,025 (2019).\n\n  Discrepancy: The Prospectus 2019 revenue (2,932,707) vs appendix 2019 (2,890,025) differ by 42,682. For 2020 the Prospectus six\u2011month figure (1,717,629) cannot be directly compared to the appendix 2020 total (3,539,231) because the appendix appears to present a different period (likely full\u2011year or LTM); but numerically they do not match.\n\n- Gross profit (Prospectus): 429,318 (six months 2020) and 752,901 (year 2019).  \n  Appendix shows gross profit totals of 899,220 (2020) and 752,901 (2019).\n\n  Discrepancy: The 2019 gross profit matches (752,901). The 2020 gross profit in the Prospectus (429,318) is not the same as the appendix 2020 value (899,220) \u2014 again likely because the appendix 2020 figure covers a different period (full year or LTM) whereas the Prospectus 429,318 is the six\u2011month (H1) gross profit.\n\nSummary / likely explanation:\n- The Prospectus figures you quoted include both six\u2011month (H1 2020) and full\u2011year 2019 numbers. The appendix figures appear to be on a different basis (the appendix\u2019s 2020 numbers look like full\u2011year or last\u201112\u2011months amounts), so the differences are caused by comparing different reporting periods (H1 vs full year/LTM) and/or different segment aggregations.\n- The only exact mismatch for the same period is revenue for 2019 (Prospectus 2,932,707 vs appendix 2,890,025) \u2014 a difference of NOK 42,682k \u2014 whereas 2019 gross profit matches (752,901).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Reconcile the full set of figures across the two documents line\u2011by\u2011line and explain each numerical difference (identify which lines are H1 vs FY vs LTM), or\n- Extract and align comparable periods (e.g., compare FY2019 from both sources) and list any remaining variances with possible reasons.
