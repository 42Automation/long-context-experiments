  "expected_answer": "Yes, there are discrepancies. In particular, the revenue per segment for Central Europe in 2019 is 596,805K NOK in the annual report and 639,486K NOK in the prospectus, which also causes the totals to differ with 2,890,025K NOK in the annual report and 2,932,707K NOK in the prospectus.",
  "output": "Yes, **there are discrepancies** between the revenue and gross profit values presented in the two tables of the prospectus, which appear to stem from **inconsistent labeling and possible misalignment in data aggregation**, rather than differences between the prospectus and an external annual report.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the key inconsistencies **within the document itself** (i.e., internal discrepancies):\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd3a 1. **Revenue Discrepancy \u2013 \"Central Europe\" Segment**\n- In **Section 10.6** (detailed table):\n  - **2019 Central Europe revenue**: **NOK 639,486,000**\n- In the **summary table under \"6. Segment reporting\"**:\n  - **2019 Central Europe revenue**: **NOK 596,805,000**\n\n\u274c **Difference: ~NOK 42.7 million**\n\n> This is a clear inconsistency for the same period and segment.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd3a 2. **Gross Profit \u2013 \"Central Europe\"**\n- In **Section 10.6**:\n  - **2019 Central Europe gross profit**: **NOK 167,235,000**\n- In **summary table**:\n  - **2019 Central Europe gross profit**: **NOK 167,235,000** \u2705 (matches)\n\n\u2705 **Gross profit matches**, but revenue does not \u2014 which raises questions about how gross profit was derived if revenue differs.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd3a 3. **Global Messaging \u2013 2020 Revenue**\n- In **Section 10.6 (six months ended 30 June 2020)**:\n  - **H1 2020 Global Messaging revenue**: **NOK 264,028,000**\n- In **summary table (full year 2020)**:\n  - **Full-year 2020 Global Messaging revenue**: **NOK 478,553,000**\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f If H1 was NOK 264M, full-year ~NOK 478.6M implies H2 was only ~NOK 214.5M \u2014 possible, but not explicitly reconciled.\n\nHowever, **no full-year 2020 data is provided in Section 10.6**, so the summary table appears to include **estimated or unaudited full-year 2020 figures**, while Section 10.6 only reports H1 2020 and full-year up to 2019.\n\nThus, this may reflect **different reporting periods**, not a direct discrepancy \u2014 but the lack of clarity is problematic.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd3a 4. **Nordics vs. Northern Europe Labeling**\n- In **Section 10.6**, the segment is called **\"Nordics\"**\n- In **summary table**, it's labeled **\"Northern Europe\"**\n- But both include Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Baltics \u2192 likely the same segment.\n\nYet:\n- **2019 Nordics revenue (10.6)**: **NOK 980,105,000**\n- **2019 Northern Europe (summary)**: **NOK 980,105,000** \u2705 (matches)\n\n\u2705 So the data matches, but **naming is inconsistent**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd3a 5. **Western Europe \u2013 2020 Full Year**\n- H1 2020 (Section 10.6): **NOK 534,147,000**\n- Full-year 2020 (summary): **NOK 1,125,316,000**\n\u27a1\ufe0f Implies H2: ~NOK 591.2M \u2014 **a 10.7% increase** \u2014 plausible.\n\nBut again, **no full-year 2020 audited data is provided in 10.6**, so the summary table likely contains **management estimates**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Conclusion:\n\n| Issue | Type | Severity |\n|------|------|----------|\n| Central Europe 2019 revenue mismatch | **Direct discrepancy** | \ud83d\udd34 **Serious** |\n| Use of \"Nordics\" vs \"Northern Europe\" | **Inconsistent labeling** | \ud83d\udfe1 Moderate |\n| Full-year 2020 figures not in 10.6 | **Incomplete disclosure** | \ud83d\udfe1 Moderate |\n| Summary table includes unaudited/estimated data without clear label | **Lack of transparency** | \ud83d\udfe1 |\n\n> \u2757 The **most critical issue** is the **NOK 42.7 million difference in Central Europe 2019 revenue** between two tables in the same document. This suggests either a **data error, mislabeling, or incorrect aggregation**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Yes, there are discrepancies within the prospectus itself**, particularly:\n- **Central Europe 2019 revenue** is listed as **NOK 639.5 million** in Section 10.6 but **NOK 596.8 million** in the summary table \u2014 a difference of **NOK 42.7 million**.\n- Inconsistent segment naming (e.g., \"Nordics\" vs \"Northern Europe\").\n- Summary table includes full-year 2020 estimates not reconciled with H1 2020 data.\n\nThese raise concerns about **data consistency and transparency**, though no external annual report is provided for comparison. If the figures differ from the **official audited annual report**, that would constitute a more serious disclosure issue. Based solely on this document, **internal inconsistencies exist**.",
