  "expected_answer": "Yes, from the values provided, the EBITDA values for 2019 are consistent.",
  "output": "They do not match.\n\n- Prospectus (six months ended 30 June 2020): EBITDA = NOK 160.0 million (see Section 10.7.1 and the condensed income statement).\n- Annual report (full year 2020, as shown in your appendix): Adjusted EBITDA totals and reconciliation are presented, and a reconciliation shows \u201cDepreciation and amortization \u2013271,389\u201d and \u201cAdjusted EBITDA 390,842\u201d for 2020; from that reconciliation Operating profit 22,218 and Finance income (expense) -427,047 give Profit (loss) before tax -404,829. The Annual Report also lists Mobile messaging revenue etc. but the explicit plain \u201cEBITDA\u201d figure for the same period/line is not the same 160.0 million reported in the Prospectus.\n\nConclusion: the Prospectus EBITDA of NOK 160.0 million (six months to 30 June 2020) is not the same as the Annual Report\u2019s 2020 EBITDA/Adjusted EBITDA figures (which are on a different basis/period \u2014 Annual Report shows Adjusted EBITDA 390,842 for the full year 2020). The amounts differ because they cover different periods and definitions (Prospectus figure is six\u2011month EBITDA; Annual Report figures are full\u2011year Adjusted EBITDA and include different adjustments).",
