  "query": "Check the EBITDA values between the IPO prospectus and the Annual report. Do they match?",
  "model": "GPT-5-mini",
  "doc_urls": null,
  "expected_answer": "Yes, from the values provided, the EBITDA values for 2019 are consistent.",
  "output": "Short answer: No \u2014 they do not match.\n\nDetails:\n- Prospectus (12 Oct 2020) \u2014 reported Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA for the six months ended 30 June 2020:\n  - EBITDA: NOK 160.0 million\n  - Adjusted EBITDA: NOK 182.6 million\n\n- Annual report / audited consolidated financials (year ended 31 Dec 2020) \u2014 the reconciliation in note 6 / segment note shows for 2020:\n  - Adjusted EBITDA (total, by segment reconciliation): NOK 390.8 million (this is full-year 2020)\n  - The prospectus figures above are for the six\u2011month period ended 30 June 2020. The annual report\u2019s comparable half\u2011year figures appear in its interim reporting (Condensed interim financials) where the six\u2011month EBITDA is shown as NOK 160.048 million and Adjusted EBITDA as NOK 182.692 million \u2014 these match the prospectus figures (minor rounding differences only).\n\nConclusion: The apparent discrepancy comes from comparing six\u2011month figures in the prospectus to full\u2011year figures in the annual report. When compared on the same period (six months to 30 June 2020), the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA figures in the prospectus and in the Group\u2019s interim/annual reporting match (differences are rounding immaterial).",
