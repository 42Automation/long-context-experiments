  "output": "They do not match.\n\nFrom the IPO prospectus (first table):\n- Adjusted EBITDA YTD 2020 = 182,692\n- Adjusted EBITDA YTD 2019 = 134,306\n- Adjusted EBITDA Year 2019 = 307,941\n\nFrom the Annual Report 2020 (second table):\n- Adjusted EBITDA 2020 = 390,842\n- Adjusted EBITDA 2019 = 307,941\n\nDifferences:\n- The prospectus shows a YTD 2020 Adjusted EBITDA of 182,692, whereas the Annual Report shows 390,842 for 2020 \u2014 a large discrepancy.\n- The prospectus and Annual Report both show 307,941 for Year 2019 (match).\n- The prospectus shows YTD 2019 = 134,306; the Annual Report aggregates 2019 as 307,941 (so the YTD 2019 figure in the prospectus does not match the Annual Report\u2019s 2019 total).\n\nConclusion: 2019 full-year Adjusted EBITDA matches (307,941). The 2020/\u201cYTD\u201d figures differ between the documents and do not match.",
