  "expected_answer": "Yes, from the values provided, the EBITDA values for 2019 are consistent.",
  "output": "No, the **Adjusted EBITDA values do not match** between the two tables presented \u2014 one labeled as \"YTD 2020 / YTD 2019 / Year 2019\" and the other as full-year \"2020 / 2019\" from the annual report.\n\n### Key Discrepancies:\n\n#### 1. **Total Adjusted EBITDA**\n- **From first table (labeled YTD 2020 / Year 2019):**\n  - YTD 2020: **182,692**\n  - Year 2019: **307,941**\n- **From second table (labeled 2020 / 2019):**\n  - 2020: **390,842**\n  - 2019: **307,941**\n\n\u2705 The **2019 full-year Adjusted EBITDA (307,941)** matches in both tables.  \n\u274c The **2020 Adjusted EBITDA does not match**:  \n- 182,692 (YTD) vs. 390,842 (full year) \u2192 These cannot both be full-year 2020 values.\n\n> This suggests that the **first table shows only Year-to-Date (YTD) data as of a certain point in 2020 (likely Q3 or earlier)**, while the second table shows **full-year 2020 results**.\n\n#### 2. **Segment-Level Adjusted EBITDA (2020)**\n| Segment | First Table (YTD 2020) | Second Table (Full Year 2020) |\n|--------|------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Nordics | 118,942 | Included in Northern Europe: 240,485 |\n| Central Europe | 57,945 | 129,283 |\n| Western Europe | 55,118 | 127,826 |\n| Global Messaging | 12,442 | 27,150 |\n| Group Costs | (61,755) | (133,902) |\n\n- All segment values in the second table are **significantly higher** than those in the first.\n- Also note: In the second table, **Nordics is merged into \"Northern Europe\"**, possibly including Baltics or other regions.\n\n#### 3. **Reconciliation to Profit Before Tax**\n- First table:  \n  - Adjusted EBITDA 2020: 182,692 \u2192 Profit before tax: (242,002)\n- Second table:  \n  - Adjusted EBITDA 2020: 390,842 \u2192 Profit before tax: (404,829)\n\nAgain, the second set reflects **full-year figures**, while the first appears to be **interim (YTD)**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\u274c The **Adjusted EBITDA values do not match** because:\n- The **first set of data is Year-to-Date (YTD) as of partway through 2020**, likely Q3.\n- The **second set is full-year 2020 and 2019**, from the **Annual Report**.\n\nTherefore, the difference is **due to timing (partial year vs. full year)**, not an error \u2014 but **they are not comparable directly**.\n\n\u2705 However, the **full-year 2019 Adjusted EBITDA (307,941)** matches exactly in both, confirming consistency for that year.\n\nSo:  \n- **Do they match?** \u2192 **No**, for 2020, because one is YTD and the other is full-year.  \n- **Is there a conflict?** \u2192 **No**, if you understand the scope (YTD vs. full-year).  \n- **Are the annual report numbers consistent?** \u2192 **Yes**, the full-year 2020 and 2019 figures are internally consistent.",
