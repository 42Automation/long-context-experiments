  "output": "Based on the provided documents:\n\n**1. IPO Prospectus (dated October 12, 2020):**\n*   **EBITDA:**\n    *   Six months ended 30 June 2020: NOK 160.0 million\n    *   Year ended 31 December 2019: NOK 210.4 million\n*   **Adjusted EBITDA:**\n    *   Six months ended 30 June 2020: NOK 182.6 million\n    *   Year ended 31 December 2019: NOK 307.5 million\n    *   Forecasted for full year 2020: NOK 360 million - NOK 370 million (Section 11.4.8)\n\n**2. Annual Report 2020:**\n*   **EBITDA:**\n    *   Year ended 31 December 2020: NOK 293,607 thousand (calculated from Operating profit + Depreciation and amortization on page 54)\n    *   Year ended 31 December 2019: NOK 210,414 thousand (calculated from Operating profit + Depreciation and amortization on page 54)\n*   **Adjusted EBITDA:**\n    *   Year ended 31 December 2020: NOK 390,842 thousand (page 53)\n    *   Year ended 31 December 2019: NOK 307,941 thousand (page 53)\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   **EBITDA (unadjusted) for Year Ended 31 December 2019:**\n    *   IPO Prospectus: NOK 210.4 million\n    *   Annual Report: NOK 210.414 million\n    *   **Match:** These figures are consistent, with the minor difference likely due to rounding.\n\n*   **Adjusted EBITDA for Year Ended 31 December 2019:**\n    *   IPO Prospectus: NOK 307.5 million\n    *   Annual Report: NOK 307.941 million\n    *   **Match:** These figures are very close, with the minor difference likely due to rounding.\n\n*   **EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for Year Ended 31 December 2020:**\n    *   The IPO Prospectus (dated October 2020) only provides actual data up to June 30, 2020, and a *forecast* for the full year 2020.\n    *   The Annual Report 2020 provides the *actual* full-year 2020 figures.\n    *   Therefore, the actual full-year 2020 figures from the Annual Report (EBITDA: NOK 293.607 million; Adjusted EBITDA: NOK 390.842 million) do not directly match the 6-month figures from the IPO Prospectus.\n    *   Comparing the IPO Prospectus's *forecasted* Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2020 (NOK 360-370 million) with the Annual Report's *actual* Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2020 (NOK 390.842 million), the actual result is higher than the forecast.\n\nIn summary, the 2019 full-year EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA figures are consistent between the two documents. The 2020 figures differ because the IPO prospectus contained only partial-year actuals and full-year forecasts, while the Annual Report presents the final full-year actuals for 2020.",
