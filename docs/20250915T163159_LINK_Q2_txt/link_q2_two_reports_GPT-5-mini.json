  "output": "Based on the prospectus, fluctuations in NOK/EUR, NOK/DKK and NOK/SEK have the most significant impact on the Group\u2019s financial reporting and results. Of those three, the prospectus singles out NOK/EUR as having the largest absolute exposure (e.g., 80% of 2019 revenue was generated in currencies other than NOK and the EUR\u2011denominated debt is a major source of FX impact). \n\nSo: NOK/EUR has the strongest impact, followed by NOK/DKK and NOK/SEK.",
