  "doc_urls": null,
  "expected_answer": "Yes, from the values provided, the EBITDA values for 2019 are consistent.",
  "output": "No, the full-year Adjusted EBITDA values **do not match** between the two tables.\n\n- In the **IPO prospectus-style table** (labeled \"Adjusted EBITDA per segment\" with 2020 and 2019 columns), the **Total Adjusted EBITDA for 2019 is 307,941** \u2014 this matches the \"Year 2019\" value in the earlier YTD table.\n- However, for **2020**, the **Total Adjusted EBITDA is listed as 390,842** in the second table, while in the **YTD 2020** column of the first table, the Adjusted EBITDA is **182,692**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **2019 full-year Adjusted EBITDA (307,941)** matches in both documents.\n\nBut the **2020 full-year Adjusted EBITDA does not match**:\n- One table shows **182,692** (YTD 2020, likely not full-year),\n- The other shows **390,842** (labeled as 2020, presumably full-year).\n\nThus, unless \"YTD 2020\" is mislabeled and not actually year-to-date, the values are inconsistent. Given the context, **390,842** likely represents the **full-year 2020 Adjusted EBITDA**, while **182,692** is only **first half or partial year**.\n\n\u2705 **Final Answer:**  \nThe **2019 full-year Adjusted EBITDA (307,941)** matches in both documents.  \nThe **2020 values do not match** \u2014 **182,692 (YTD)** vs. **390,842 (full-year)** \u2014 so they are **not consistent**.",
