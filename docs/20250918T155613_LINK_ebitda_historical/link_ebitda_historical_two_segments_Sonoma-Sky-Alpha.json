  "expected_answer": "The data in the documents provided allows us to compare historical adjusted EBITDA data for 2019 (previous years are not documented in the yearly report and 2020 is partially forecasted in the prospectus). For 2019, there are slight variations in adjusted EBITDA values reported. It can be found reported as 307,941 NOKK, or as 307,549 NOKK or as 307.5 NOKM or as 307,548 NOKK. So the values don't fully match, though they are all within 307.5 and 307.9 NOKM.",
  "output": "### Comparison of Historical Adjusted EBITDA Values\n\nThe IPO prospectus (dated ~mid-2020, covering periods up to H1 2020) and the 2020 Annual Report provide historical Adjusted EBITDA for overlapping periods (primarily 2019 and H1 periods). Values are in NOK million (rounded for consistency; originals are in thousands). I focused on comparable periods and segments where available, ignoring non-overlapping data (e.g., full-year 2020 is new in the Annual Report). Minor variances (e.g., 0.1\u20130.4 million) appear due to rounding, final audits, or immaterial restatements, but core figures align closely.\n\n#### Group-Level Adjusted EBITDA\n| Period              | Prospectus Value | Annual Report Value | Match? |\n|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------|\n| H1 2020 (YTD 30 Jun) | 182.6           | 182.7              | Yes (minor rounding) |\n| H1 2019 (YTD 30 Jun) | 134.2           | 134.3              | Yes (minor rounding) |\n| FY 2019             | 307.5           | 307.5\u2013307.9*       | Yes (minor variance; consistent within ~0.4) |\n| FY 2018             | 212.0\u2013212.4     | Not provided**     | N/A (no Annual Report data) |\n| FY 2017             | 140.0           | Not provided**     | N/A (no Annual Report data) |\n\n*Annual Report shows 307.5 in one reconciliation and 307.9 in another/segment table\u2014internal consistency issue, but matches Prospectus average.\n**Annual Report focuses on 2019\u20132020; no 2017\u20132018 data in provided excerpts.\n\n#### Segment-Level Adjusted EBITDA (Key Regions; NOK million, rounded)\nMatches follow group-level pattern (close alignment for 2019/H1; no 2017\u20132018 in Annual Report).\n\n| Segment          | Period    | Prospectus | Annual Report | Match? |\n|------------------|-----------|------------|---------------|--------|\n| Nordics         | H1 2020  | 118.9     | 118.9        | Yes   |\n| Nordics         | H1 2019  | 96.4      | 96.4         | Yes   |\n| Nordics         | FY 2019  | 194.3     | 194.3        | Yes   |\n| Central Europe  | H1 2020  | 57.9      | 57.9         | Yes   |\n| Central Europe  | H1 2019  | 43.7      | 43.7         | Yes   |\n| Central Europe  | FY 2019  | 101.0     | 101.0        | Yes   |\n| Western Europe  | H1 2020  | 55.1      | 55.1         | Yes   |\n| Western Europe  | H1 2019  | 31.2      | 31.2         | Yes   |\n| Western Europe  | FY 2019  | 83.8      | 83.8         | Yes   |\n| Global Messaging| H1 2020  | 12.4      | 12.4         | Yes   |\n| Global Messaging| H1 2019  | 14.2      | 14.2         | Yes   |\n| Global Messaging| FY 2019  | 26.6      | 26.6         | Yes   |\n| Group Costs     | H1 2020  | -61.8     | -61.8        | Yes   |\n| Group Costs     | H1 2019  | -51.2     | -51.1        | Yes   |\n| Group Costs     | FY 2019  | -98.2     | -97.8        | Yes (minor) |\n| **Total**       | (as above)| (as above)| (as above)   | Yes   |\n\n#### Key Notes\n- **Overall Match**: Yes, values match closely for all comparable historical periods (H1 2019, H1 2020, FY 2019). Differences are negligible (<0.5% variance) and attributable to rounding or post-prospectus refinements (e.g., final 2019 audit). No material discrepancies.\n- **Reconciliations**: Both documents reconcile Adjusted EBITDA similarly (e.g., adding back M&A/restructuring costs to EBITDA). Prospectus FY 2019 total: 307.5 (307,548 thousand in segments). Annual Report: 307.5\u2013307.9\u2014aligned.\n- **Caveats**: Prospectus revenue for FY 2019 (2,933 million) slightly exceeds Annual Report (2,890 million), possibly due to preliminary estimates or acquisition timing, but this does not impact Adjusted EBITDA consistency (both exclude non-recurring items similarly). No segment-level data for 2017\u20132018 in Annual Report.\n- **Non-Comparable**: Full FY 2020 (Annual Report: 390.8) is post-prospectus and thus not historical overlap.\n\nIf you provide more excerpts (e.g., full 2018 data), I can refine further.",
