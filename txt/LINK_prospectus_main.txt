                                LINK MOBILITY GROUP HOLDING ASA                   
                          (A public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Norway)
                      Initial public offering of up to 146,855,000 shares at an offer price of NOK 47.00 per share
                           Listing of the Company's ordinary shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange
                                                                                  
        This prospectus (the "Prospectus") has been prepared in connection with the initial public offering (the "Offering") of ordinary shares of LINK Mobility Group
        Holding ASA (the "Company" or "LINK Mobility"), a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Norway (together with its consolidated
        subsidiaries, "LINK" or the "Group"), and the related listing (the "Listing") of the Company's shares, each with a nominal value of NOK 0.005 (the "Shares")
        on the Oslo Børs, a stock exchange operated by Oslo Børs ASA (the "Oslo Stock Exchange"). The Offering comprises a primary offering of up to 53,200,000
        new Shares to be issued by the Company (the "New Shares") to raise gross proceeds of up to approximately NOK 2,500 million and a secondary offering of up
        to 74,500,000 existing Shares (the "Sale Shares") offered by Victory Partners VIII Limited (the "Principal Shareholder") and the other selling shareholders
        as set out in Section 14 "Selling Shareholders" (collectively and together with the Principal Shareholder, the "Selling Shareholders"). The New Shares, together
        with the Sale Shares and, unless the context indicates otherwise, the Additional Shares (as defined herein), are referred to herein as the "Offer Shares". The
        price (the "Offer Price") at which the Offer Shares will be sold is NOK 47.00 per Offer Share.
        The Offering consists of: (i) a private placement to (a) institutional investors in Norway, (b) institutional and certain other eligible investors outside Norway and
        the United States of America (the "U.S." or the "United States"), subject to applicable exemptions from applicable prospectus and registration requirements,
        and (c) persons reasonably believed to be "qualified institutional buyers" ("QIBs") in the United States as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A ("Rule
        144A") or another available exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (as amended)
        (the "U.S. Securities Act") (the "Institutional Offering") and (ii) a retail offering to the public in Norway (the "Retail Offering"). All offers and sales outside
        the United States will be made in "offshore transactions" as defined in, and in compliance with, Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act ("Regulation S").
        ABGSC (as defined below), acting as stabilisation manager in the Offering on behalf of the Managers (as defined below) (the "Stabilisation Manager"), may
        elect to over-allot up to 19,155,000 additional Shares (the "Additional Shares"), equal to up to approximately 15% of the number of New Shares and Sale
        Shares offered in the Offering (and in any case limited to 15% of the total number of Shares allocated in the Offering). In order to facilitate such over-allotment,
        the Selling Shareholders, other than the CEO and LINK ESOT AS, (collectively the "Lending Selling Shareholders") are expected to grant the Stabilisation
        Manager, on behalf of the Managers, an option to borrow a number of Shares equal to the number of Additional Shares (the "Lending Option"). The Lending
        Selling Shareholders are further expected to grant the Stabilisation Manager, on behalf of the Managers, an option to purchase, at the Offer Price, a number of
        Shares equal to the number of Additional Shares to cover short positions resulting from any over-allotments made in connection with the Offering (the "Over-
        Allotment Option"). The Over-Allotment Option is exercisable, in whole or in part by the Stabilisation Manager, on behalf of the Managers, within a 30-day
        period commencing at the time at which "if issued/if sold" trading in the Shares commences on the Oslo Stock Exchange, on the terms and subject to the
        conditions described in this Prospectus. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of either the Sale Shares or any Additional Shares.
        The offer period for the Institutional Offering will commence at 09:00 hours (Oslo time, central European summer time, "CEST") on 14 October 2020 and close
        at 14:00 hours (CEST) on 20 October 2020 (the "Bookbuilding Period"). The application period for the Retail Offering (the "Application Period") will
        commence at 09:00 hours (CEST) on 14 October 2020 and close at 12:00 hours (CEST) on 20 October 2020. The Bookbuilding Period and the Application Period
        may, at the Company's and the Principal Shareholder's sole discretion, in consultation with the Managers, and for any reason, be extended beyond the set times,
        but will in no event be extended beyond 14:00 hours (CET) on 30 October 2020. See Section 17 "The terms of the Offering" for further information.
        The Shares (including the Sale Shares and the Additional Shares) are, and the New Shares will be, registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository
        (the "VPS") in book-entry form. Except where the context otherwise requires, references in this Prospectus to the Shares will be deemed to include the Offer
        Shares.                                                                   
        Investing in the Offer Shares involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should read the entire Prospectus and, in particular, consider
        Section 2 "Risk factors" when considering an investment in the Company.   
        The Offer Shares have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or with any securities regulatory authority of any state
        or other jurisdiction in the United States, and are being offered and sold: (i) in the United States only to persons who are reasonably believed
        to be QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A or another available exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of
        the U.S. Securities Act; and (ii) outside the United States in "offshore transactions" as defined in, and in compliance with, Regulation S.
        Prospective investors are notified that any seller of the Offer Shares may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the
        U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The distribution of this Prospectus and the offer and sale of the Offer Shares may be restricted by
        law in certain jurisdictions. Persons in possession of this Prospectus are required by the Company and the Managers to inform themselves about
        and to observe any such restrictions. Failure to comply with these regulations may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such
        jurisdictions. See Section 18 "Selling and transfer restrictions".        
        Prior to the Offering, the Shares have not been publicly traded. On or about 13 October 2020, the Company expects to apply for the Shares to be admitted for
        trading and listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange, and completion of the Offering is subject to the approval of the listing application by the Oslo Stock Exchange,
        the satisfaction of the listing conditions set by the Oslo Stock Exchange and certain other conditions as set out in Section 17.15 "Conditions for completion of
        the Offering – Listing and trading of the Offer Shares". The Shares will be eligible for clearing through the facilities of the Oslo Stock Exchange.
        The due date by which payment in respect of the Offer Shares in the Retail Offering is required to be received is expected to be on or about 22 October 2020.
        The date by which payment in respect of the Offer Shares in the Institutional Offering is required to be received is expected to be on or about 23 October 2020.
        Delivery of the Offer Shares in the Retail Offer and the Institutional Offering is expected to take place on or about 23 October 2020, through the facilities of the
        VPS. The Offering is subject to certain conditions. The first day of trading on an "if issued/if sold basis" of the Shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange under the
        ticker code "LINK" is expected to be 21 October 2020. If closing of the Offering does not take place on 23 October 2020 or at all, the Offering may be withdrawn,
        resulting in all applications for Offer Shares being disregarded, any allocations made being deemed not to have been made and any payments made being
        returned without any interest or other compensation. All dealings in the Shares prior to settlement and delivery are at the sole risk of the parties concerned.

        This Prospectus has been prepared by the Company in connection with the Offering of the Offer Shares and the Listing of the Shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange.
        This Prospectus has been prepared to comply with the Norwegian Securities Trading Act of 29 June 2007 no. 75, as amended (the "Norwegian Securities

        This Prospectus has been approved by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway (Nw.: Finanstilsynet) (the "Norwegian FSA"), as the competent authority
        under the EU Prospectus Regulation. The Norwegian FSA only approves this Prospectus as meeting the standards of completeness, comprehensibility and
        consistency imposed by the EU Prospectus Regulation, and such approval should not be considered as an endorsement of the issuer or the quality of the
        securities that are the subject of this Prospectus. Investors should make their own assessment as to the suitability of investing in the securities.
        For definitions of certain other terms used throughout this Prospectus, see Section 20 "Definitions and glossary".

        AS and the Joint Global Coordinators as "Joint Bookrunners" in the Offering. SpareBank 1 Markets AS has been engaged as co-lead manager in the Offering.

        23 of the EU Prospectus Regulation, significant new factors, material mistakes or material inaccuracies relating to the information included in this Prospectus,
        which may affect the assessment of the Offer Shares and which arises or is noted between the time when the Prospectus is approved by the Norwegian FSA and
        the listing of the Shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange, will be mentioned in a supplement to this Prospectus without undue delay. Neither the publication nor
        distribution of this Prospectus, nor the sale of any Offer Share, shall under any circumstances imply that there has been no change in the Group's affairs or that
        the information herein is correct of any date subsequent to the date of this Prospectus.
        No person is authorised to give information or to make any representation concerning the Group or the Selling Shareholders or in connection with the Offering
        or the sale of the Offer Shares other than as contained in this Prospectus. If any such information is given or made, it must not be relied upon as having been
        authorised by the Company, or the Selling Shareholders or the Managers or by any of the affiliates, representatives, advisors or selling agents of any of the
        foregoing.                                                                
        The distribution of this Prospectus and the offer and sale of the Offer Shares in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law. This Prospectus
        does not constitute an offer of, or an invitation to purchase, any of the Offer Shares in any jurisdiction in which such offer or sale would be
        unlawful. Neither this Prospectus nor any advertisement or any other offering material may be distributed or published in any jurisdiction
        except under circumstances that will result in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Persons in possession of this Prospectus are
        required to inform themselves about, and to observe, any such restrictions. In addition, the Shares are subject to restrictions on transferability
        and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under applicable securities laws and regulations. Investors should be
        aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time. Any failure to comply with these
        restrictions may constitute a violation of applicable securities laws. See Section 18 "Selling and transfer restrictions".
        This Prospectus and the terms and conditions of the Offering as set out in this Prospectus and any sale and purchase of Offer Shares shall be governed by, and
        construed in accordance with, Norwegian law. The courts of Norway, with Oslo City Court as legal venue, shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute
        which may arise out of or in connection with the Offering or this Prospectus.
        In making an investment decision, prospective investors must rely on their own examination, analysis of, and enquiry into, the Group and the terms of the
        Offering, including the merits and risks involved. None of the Company, or the Selling Shareholders or the Managers, or any of their respective representatives
        or advisers, is making any representation to any offeree or purchaser of the Offer Shares regarding the legality of an investment in the Offer Shares by such
        offeree or purchaser under the laws applicable to such offeree or purchaser. Each investor should consult with his or her own advisors as to the legal, tax,
        business, financial and related aspects of a purchase of the Offer Shares.
        All Sections of the Prospectus should be read in context with the information included in Section 4 "General information".

        upon or endorsed the merits of the Offering or the adequacy or accuracy of this Prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United
        States.

        In any member state of the European Economic Area (the "EEA") other than Norway and in the United Kingdom (each, a "Relevant State"), this communication
        is only addressed to and is only directed at persons who are "qualified investors" within the meaning of Article 2(e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation. The
        Prospectus has been prepared on the basis that all offers of Offer Shares outside Norway will be made pursuant to an exemption under the EU Prospectus
        Regulation from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offer of shares. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer of Offer Shares
        which is the subject of the Offering contemplated in this Prospectus within any Relevant State should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises
        for the Company or any of the Managers to publish a prospectus or a supplement to a prospectus under the EU Prospectus Regulation for such offer. Neither
        the Company nor the Managers have authorised, nor do they authorise, the making of any offer of Shares through any financial intermediary, other than offers
        made by Managers which constitute the final placement of Offer Shares contemplated in this Prospectus.
        Each person in a Relevant State other than, in the case of paragraph (a), persons receiving offers contemplated in this Prospectus in Norway, who receives any
        communication in respect of, or who acquires any Offer Shares under, the offers contemplated in this Prospectus will be deemed to have represented, warranted
        and agreed to and with the Managers and the Company that:                 
              a)    it is a "qualified investor" within the meaning of Article 2(e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation; and
              b)    in the case of any Offer Shares acquired by it as a financial intermediary, as that term is used in the EU Prospectus Regulation, (i)
                    such Offer Shares acquired by it in the Offering have not been acquired on behalf of, nor have they been acquired with a view to
                    their offer or resale to, persons in any Relevant State other than qualified investors, as that term is defined in the EU Prospectus
                    Regulation, or in circumstances in which the prior consent of the Managers has been given to the offer or resale; or (ii) where such
                    Offer Shares have been acquired by it on behalf of persons in any Relevant State other than qualified investors, the offer of those
                    Offer Shares to it is not treated under the EU Prospectus Regulation as having been made to such persons.
        For the purposes of this provision, the expression an "offer to the public" in relation to any Offer Shares in any Relevant State means a communication to
        persons in any form and by any means presenting sufficient information on the terms of the Offering and the Offer Shares to be offered, so as to enable an
        investor to decide to acquire any Offer Shares.                           
        See Section 18 "Selling and transfer restrictions" for certain other notices to investors.
                                 NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN CANADA                    
        The Offer Shares may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are accredited investors, as defined in National
        Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument
        31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the Offer Shares must be made in accordance with an
        exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws.
        Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for rescission or damages if this Prospectus (including
        any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time
        limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser's province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities
        legislation of the purchaser's province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.
        Pursuant to Section 3A.3 (or, in the case of securities issued or guaranteed by the government of a non-Canadian jurisdiction, Section 3A.4) of National
        Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the Managers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding
        underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.       
                                 INFORMATION TO DISTRIBUTORS                      
        Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended
        ("MiFID II"); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures (together,
        the "MiFID II Product Governance Requirements"), and disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which any
        "manufacturer" (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the Shares have been subject
        to a product approval process, which has determined that such shares are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and investors who meet
        the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in MiFID II (the "Positive Target Market"); and (ii) eligible for distribution
        through all distribution channels as are permitted by MiFID II (the "Appropriate Channels for Distribution"). Distributors should note that: the price of the
        Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment
        in the Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate
        financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses
        that may result therefrom. Conversely, an investment in the Shares is not compatible with investors looking for full capital protection or full repayment of the
        amount invested or having no risk tolerance, or investors requiring a fully guaranteed income or fully predictable return profile (the "Negative Target Market"
        and, together with the Positive Target Market, the "Target Market Assessment").
        The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Offering.
        For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II;
        or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Shares.
        Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own Target Market Assessment in respect of the Shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.
                                     STABILISATION                                
        In connection with the Offering and in accordance with all applicable laws and rules, ABGSC, in its capacity as Stabilisation Manager for the Offering on behalf
        of the Managers, may (but will be under no obligation to) effect stabilisation transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Shares during the
        stabilisation period at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, stabilisation action may not necessarily occur and may cease at any
        time. Any stabilisation action may begin on or after the date of commencement of trading of the Shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange on an "if issued/if sold"
        basis and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no later than 30 days after that date. Any stabilisation action must be conducted by the
        Stabilisation Manager in accordance with all applicable laws and rules and can be undertaken at the offices of the Stabilisation Manager and on the Oslo Stock
        Exchange. Stabilisation may result in an exchange or market price of the Shares that is higher than might otherwise prevail, and the exchange or market price
        may reach a level that cannot be maintained on a permanent basis.         
        Any stabilisation activities will be conducted based on the same principles as set out in Section 3-12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act and the EC
        Commission Regulation 2273/2003 regarding buy-back programmes and stabilisation of financial instruments.
                                ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES                  
        LINK Mobility Group Holding ASA is a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Norway. As a result, the rights of holders of the Shares will
        be governed by Norwegian law and the Company's articles of association (the "Articles of Association"). The rights of shareholders under Norwegian law may
        differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. In particular, Norwegian law limits the circumstances under which
        shareholders of Norwegian companies may bring derivative actions. For example, under Norwegian law, any action brought by the Company in respect of
        wrongful acts committed against the Company will be prioritised over actions brought by shareholders claiming compensation in respect of such acts. The
        majority of the members of the Company's board of directors (the "Board members" and the "Board" or "Board of Directors", respectively) and the members
        of the senior management of the Company (the "Management") are not residents of the United States. Furthermore most of the Company's assets and most
        the assets of the Board members and members of Management are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be impossible or difficult for investors
        in the United States to effect service of process upon the Company, the Board members and members of Management in the United States or to enforce against
                                         iii                                      
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        the Company or those persons judgments obtained in U.S. courts, whether predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws or other laws
        of the United States.                                                     
        The United States and Norway do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitral awards) in
        civil and commercial matters. Uncertainty exists as to whether courts in Norway will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions, including the United
        States, against the Company or its Board members or members of Management under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in Norway
        against the Company or the Board members or members of Management under the securities laws of other jurisdictions. In addition, awards of punitive damages
        in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may not be enforceable in Norway. Similar restrictions may apply in other jurisdictions.
                                   AVAILABLE INFORMATION                          
        The Company has agreed that, for so long as any of the Offer Shares are "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the U.S. Securities
        Act, it will during any period in which it is neither subject to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "U.S. Exchange
        Act"), nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the U.S. Exchange Act, provide to any holder or beneficial owners of Shares, or to any
        prospective purchaser designated by any such registered holder, upon the request of such holder, beneficial owner or prospective owner, the information
        required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) of the U.S. Securities Act. The Company will also make available to each such holder or beneficial owner,
        all notices of shareholders' meetings and other reports and communications that are made generally available to the Company's shareholders.
                                     DATA PROTECTION                              
        As data controllers, each of the Managers processes personal data to deliver the products and services that are agreed between the parties and for other
        purposes, such as to comply with laws and other regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the "GDPR") and the Norwegian
        Data Protection Act of 15 June 2018 No. 38. The personal data will be processed as long as necessary for the purposes, and will subsequently be deleted unless
        there is a statutory duty to keep it. For detailed information on each Manager’s processing of personal data, please review such Manager’s privacy policy, which
        is available on its website or by contacting the relevant Manager. The privacy policy contains information about the rights in connection with the processing of
        personal data, such as the access to information, rectification, data portability, etc. If the applicant is a corporate customer, such customer shall forward the
        relevant Manager’s privacy policy to the individuals whose personal data it discloses to the Managers.

         Distribution plan ............................. In the Institutional Offering, the Company and the Principal Shareholder,

                               made on a pro rata basis using the VPS automated simulation procedures.
                               The Company, the Principal Shareholder and the Managers reserve the right
                               to limit the total number of applicants to whom Offer Shares are allocated in
                               order to keep the number of shareholders at an appropriate level, in which
                               case the applicants to whom Offer Shares are allocated will be determined
                               on a random basis by using the VPS automated simulation procedures and/or

                               of Shares in the Company of 267,398,740, which will correspond to a dilution
                               for the existing shareholders of approximately 19.9%. This is based on the
                               assumption that the Company issues the maximum number of New Shares,
                               and that none of the existing Shareholders subscribes for any New Shares in
                               the Offering.

                               the Company or the Managers to the applicants in the Offering.

        2     RISK FACTORS                                                        
        Investing in the Shares involves inherent risks. Prior to making any investment decision with respect to the Shares, an
        investor should carefully consider all of the information contained in this Prospectus, and in particular the risks and
        uncertainties described in this Section 2, which the Company believes are the most material known risks and
        uncertainties faced by the Group as of the date hereof. The risk factors presented in this Section are limited to the risks
        that the Company believes to be specific to the issuer and material for investors when making their investment decision.
        An investment in the Shares is suitable only for investors who understand the risks associated with this type of
        investment and who can afford to lose all or part of their investment.    
        The risk factors presented in this Section are divided into a limited number of categories based on their nature. Within
        each category, the risk factors which are deemed by the Company to be the most material based on an overall
        assessment of the probability of their occurrence and the expected magnitude of their negative impact on the Group,
        are presented first. However, this does not imply that the remaining risk factors presented are ranked in order of their
        likelihood of occurrence or the severity or significance of each risk. The order of the categories does not intend to
        represent any assessment of the materiality or the probability of occurrence of the risk factors within that category,
        when compared to risk factors in another category. The absence of negative past experience associated with a given
        risk factor does not mean that the risks and uncertainties described are not a genuine potential threat to an investment
        in the Shares.                                                            
        Should any of the following risks occur, they could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, prospects,
        results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and the trading price of the Shares may decline, causing investors
        to lose all or part of their invested capital. Additional risks not presently known to the Company or which the Company
        currently deems not to be material may also have a material adverse effect on the Group. A prospective investor should
        consult his or her own expert advisors as to the suitability of an investment in the Company's Shares. It is not possible
        to quantify the significance to the Company of each individual risk factor as each of the risk factors mentioned below
        may materialise to a greater or lesser degree.                            
        The information in this Section 2 is accurate as of the date of this Prospectus.
        2.1   Risks related to the Group’s business activities and industry       
        2.1.1 The Group may not be able to implement its M&A strategy successfully or manage its growth effectively
        The Group’s future growth will depend on the successful implementation of the six main pillars of the Group's business
        strategy. See Section 8.4 "Strategy and objectives". Mergers and acquisitions are a key component of the Group’s growth
        strategy (see Section 11.3.2 for an overview of the Group's previous acquisitions). The Group’s failure to execute its
        business strategy or to manage its growth effectively could adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of
        operations, cash flows and financial position. The Group’s Acquisition Revenue was NOK 104.0 million, NOK 803.9 million,
        NOK 584.1 million and NOK 38.6 million, for the periods ending 30 June 2020 and 31 December 2019, 2018 and 2017,
        respectively. In addition, there can be no guarantee that, even if the Group successfully implements the Group’s strategy,
        it would result in an improvement of the Group’s results of operations. The Group’s ability to achieve its business and
        financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the Group’s control.
        The integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other resources, including
        management time and attention, and may depend on the Group’s ability to retain the existing management and
        employees of the acquired business or recruit acceptable replacements. For example, it took the Group approximately
        one year to fully integrate TeraComm Group after the acquisition in 2019. Ultimately, if the Group is unsuccessful in
        integrating any acquisitions in a timely and cost-effective manner, the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations,
        cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected. Acquisitions may also expose the Group to
        liabilities that it may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition, for example, if acquired companies and business do
        not act, or have not acted, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Given the above, in particular the Group’s
        rapid growth strategy, this risk is of material and specific importance the Group. If the Group is unable to implement its
        strategy or successfully adapt to rapidly changing market conditions should consumer behaviour change, or if demand
        for its services decreases, then its business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be
        materially adversely affected.                                            
        2.1.2 The markets in which the Group competes in are undergoing rapid technological change
        The communications industry has undergone significant technological development over time and these changes
        continue to affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The CPaaS market is evolving and
        is expanding in several directions as enterprise adoption of cloud-based communications occurs. From SMS, to WhatsApp
        Business, new and more complex communication methods continue to be introduced. For example, Juniper Research
        estimates that in the next five years RCS will continue to grow and represent a larger market of the Global A2P messaging
        revenue. Such changes have had, and will continue to have, a profound impact on customers’ needs and expectations.
        For the Group to survive and grow, the Group must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of
        the Group’s information delivery and retrieval product and services to address the customer’s changing needs. If new
        industry standards and practices emerge, the Group’s existing products, services and technology may become obsolete.
        Developing the Group’s products, services and other technologies entails significant technical and business risks and
        substantial costs. In addition, demand for the Group’s platform is also price sensitive. The Group must anticipate far in
        advance which technology it should use for the development of new products and services or the enhancement of existing
        products and services, and there is no guarantee that it will anticipate such changes correctly or timely. In addition, the
        market changes may result in changes in the demand mix for the Group's services, shifting them from high margin
        services such as advanced mobile solutions (Mobile Invoice, e.g.) to low margin services such as OTP traffic, resulting
        could result in an erosion of the Group’s margins. Given the above, in particular the rapid technological development in
        the market, changes in consumer sentiments and the expansion of the array of products available within the Group’s
                                         8                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        market, this risk is of material and specific importance the Group. If the Group is unable to properly anticipate and
        address changes in the market and expectations of its customers, the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations,
        cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected. For more information regarding the risk the
        implementation of the Group’s strategy, see Section 2.1.1 "The Group may not be able to implement its M&A strategy
        successfully or manage its growth effectively".                           
        2.1.3 The Group may experience operational problems, system failures, defects or errors
        The Group's platform and services are based on inherently complex software technology, which may have real or
        perceived defects, errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in the platform and the Group's products could result in
        negative publicity or lead to data security, access, retention or other performance issues. The Group relies on network
        and information systems for its operations, some of which it outsources, and a disruption or failure of, or defects in,
        those systems may disrupt its operations, damage its reputation with customers and adversely affect its results of
        operations. Operational problems may lead to loss of revenue or higher than anticipated operating expenses may require
        additional capital expenditures. See Section 2.2.1 "The Group outsources certain of its IT functions to third parties and
        an interruption or cessation of any such services could adversely affect the Group". Any significant disruption, system
        failure, errors or defects could compromise the Group's ability to deliver contractual services and/or increased costs and
        result in the loss of customers, curtailed operations and the Group's reputation, any of which could have materially
        adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
        2.1.4 The Group is exposed to risks related to cyberattacks               
        As the Group’s business and business strategy are tied to its technology, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms
        and other destructive or disruptive software, "cyber-attacks," phishing attacks and other malicious activity, can have a
        material effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations. For example, in last 12 months, several DDoS
        attacks were launched against the Group, and although the Group did not experience any material breaches, such events
        could have an adverse impact on the Group and its customers, including degradation of service, service disruption,
        excessive call volume to call centres, theft and damage to its plant, equipment and data, costs associated with
        remediation, notification, and potential damages to third parties affected by such malicious activities.
        IT security breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of the Group's systems and potential unauthorized disclosure
        of confidential information or data, including personal data. Data security breaches may also result in negative publicity
        resulting in reputation or brand damage. If the Group experiences a material data security breach or fails to detect and
        appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash
        flows, financial position and reputation could be materially adversely affected. Given the above, in particular that the
        Group has been subject in the past to cyberattacks and the nature of the Group’s business, this risk is of material and
        specific importance the Group. If the Group is unable to protect its platform and digital structure from cyber-threats,
        this could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows
        and/or prospects.                                                         
        2.1.5 The Group may be unable to attract, retain and train the required personnel
        As a high-growth company in a rapidly changing and complex industry, the Group's success depends to a significant
        extent upon the abilities and efforts of the Group's management team and its ability to retain key members of the
        management team and other highly skilled employees. There is intense competition for personnel with skills in areas
        such as coders, software developers and software engineers in the markets in which the Group operates and there are,
        and may continue to be, shortages in the availability of appropriately such personnel at all levels. Shortages of skilled
        personnel is particular prominent for skilled local sales force employees with critical know-how and expertise that are
        key to the Group’s success given its M&A and growth strategy. For example, if the Group expands into a new market, it
        needs to hire personnel with technical skills such as C# developers, but also with knowledge about the CPaaS market in
        such particular jurisdiction. Such layering of skills are difficult to find.
        Key to the Group's successful integration of acquired business has been the ability to insert into such businesses
        seasoned senior management from the Group, who are able to ensure that the Group’s methodology and business
        practices are properly implemented and applied throughout the acquired organisation. If the Group is unable to retain
        its senior management team, its M&A and growth strategy may be hindered. Because the Group operates in a relatively
        new market, the talent pool of senior management with significant experience is scares. In addition, in order to
        seamlessly integrate and later operate any acquired business, the Group needs to retain key skilled personnel from its
        acquired businesses, which has the necessary local knowledge that can help drive growth and integrate the acquired
        platforms with the Group's systems. The employees of an acquired company often become the targets of recruiters
        trying to lure them to other opportunities given the uncertainties that arise for employees at an acquired company. If
        the Group is unable to attract and retain key management personnel and other highly skilled employees, its business,
        prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.
        2.1.6 The Group may be unable to maintain competitive prices              
        The Group’s ability to maintain or increase its profitability depends on its ability to offset decreases in sales prices by
        reducing the purchase cost of the services that it provides. In addition, pricing pressure may also be created if customers
        transact larger volumes on the Group’s platform for which they negotiate a lower price per transaction. If the Group is
        not able to negotiate correspondingly lower purchase costs from service providers for larger volumes, this may negatively
        impact the Group’s margins. If the Group is unable to offset decreases in sales prices or to otherwise maintain its
        competitive position, it may lose market share. For example, the Group has exited the Spanish market after the Group’s
        partner, Telefonica, S.A., lost many material customers to its main competitor that offered products and services at
        more competitive prices. Given the above, in particular the importance of margins to the Group’s financial success and
        the presence of local and/or international competitors in all of the markets in which the Group participates, this risk is
        of material and specific importance the Group. There can be no assurance that increased competition from current and
        potential competitors will not adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and
        financial position.

        2.1.7 The Group is dependent on intellectual property and its methods of protecting its intellectual property may
              not be adequate                                                     
        The Group’s business and business strategy are tied to its technology. Unlike other technology companies, the Group
        does not have any registered intellectual property rights and relies on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality
        undertakings and other contractual provisions to protect its intellectual property rights. Protecting its intellectual property
        is key to the Group’s prospects and financial condition. The Group cannot give assurances that its measures for
        preserving the secrecy of its trade secrets and confidentiality information are sufficient to prevent others from obtaining
        that information. The Group may not have adequate remedies to preserve the trade secrets or to seek compensation for
        its loss should its employees breach their confidentiality agreements with the Group. In addition, the Group cannot give
        assurances that its trade secrets will provide the Group with any competitive advantage, as it may become known to or
        be independently developed by the Group’s competitors, regardless of the success of any measures the Group may take
        to try to preserve their confidentiality. Any of these situations could have adversely affect the Group’s business,
        prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The realisation of any of these risks may have a
        material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
        2.1.8 The Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be adversely
              affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic                            
        The coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19"), and measures to prevent its spread, may have a material adverse impact on
        the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The severity and timing of a
        potential COVID-19 related impact will depend on a number of factors, including the level and rapidity of the spread of
        COVID-19, duration of containment measures, changes in customers’ spending patterns, measures imposed or taken by
        governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, macroeconomic conditions in the markets where the Group
        operates, and negative effects on the financial condition of its customers and suppliers.
        Under difficult economic conditions, including prolonged unemployment and employment furloughs, demand for the
        Group’s products and services could decline and some customers may become unable or unwilling to pay for the Group’s
        products and services. For example, the Group has experienced recent reductions in SMS volumes from customers in
        countries and/or regions that have implemented material business closures as a result of COVID-19. In the quarters
        ended 31 December 2019, 31 March 2020 and 30 June 2020, the Group delivered 2.9 billion messages, 2.6 billion
        messages and 2.4 billion messages respectively.                           
        Additionally, in order to prioritize the demands of the business, the Group may delay certain capital investments, which
        may adversely affect the Group’s business in the future. If these events occur and were to continue, the Group’s revenue
        may be reduced materially which could result in reduced operating margins and a reduction in cash flows.
        In addition, governmental and non-governmental initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the
        imposition of restrictions on work and public gatherings and the promotion of social distancing, along with new
        government service, collection, payment moratoria, pricing or rebate mandates may adversely impact the Group’s
        operations and financial results. The Group’s suppliers and vendors also may be affected by such measures in their
        ability to provide products and services to the Group and these measures could also make it more difficult for the Group
        to serve its customers, which in turn could adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash
        flows, financial position and reputation could exacerbate the other risks identified in this Section 2 "Risk factors". Given
        the above, in particular the effect of COVID-19 on SMS volumes, this risk is of material and specific importance the
        Group.                                                                    
        2.2   Risks related to customer relationships and third parties           
        2.2.1 The Group outsources certain of its IT functions to third parties and an interruption or cessation of any such
              services could adversely affect the Group                           
        The Group currently outsources to third-party suppliers, directly or indirectly, certain IT functions that are key to its
        operations. These suppliers provide the Group with, among others, (i) CRM software that allows the Group to log
        commercial opportunities, execute agreements and act as a customer reference data; (ii) software mediation for
        incoming and outgoing CPaaS; and (iii) billing software that enables the Group to rate all the traffic and produce invoices
        for customers as well as interconnection costs to the channel owners.     
        Outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not perform to the Group’s
        expectations, legal or contractual requirements, or may fail to perform at all. Failure of these third parties to meet their
        contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to the Group or its customers could result in material financial
        loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm. Given the importance of these IT functions to the Group,
        this risk is of material and specific importance to the Group. Any interruptions in the Group’s system could have a
        negative effect on the quality of products and services offered to the Group’s customers and, as a result, on customer
        demand. If customer demand for the Group’s products decreases, the Group’s business, reputation, prospects, results
        of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.
        2.2.2 The Group relies on a limited number of suppliers for key elements of its operations, and an interruption or
              cessation of any such services could adversely affect the Group     
        The Group’s operations are integrated with technical services from third party suppliers in connection with mobile
        interaction with end-users, which includes delivery of outgoing messages (mobile terminated messages) and receiving
        incoming messages (mobile originated messages). Examples of such third party suppliers are telecom operators for SMS
        communication, Facebook for communication through Facebook Messenger and Apple for App-push notices. In addition,
        LINK Mobile Payment also relies on third parties for the supply of its payments services (transaction processing),
        including payment providers such as Visa or MasterCard, financial institutions and payment gateways that link the Group
        to the card and bank clearing networks. If any of these companies materially and adversely changes the terms of their
        services or refuse or fail to process transactions adequately, any such action could have a material adverse effect on the
                                        10                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For instance, if telecom operators
        within a jurisdiction materially increase their prices, the Group may not be able to fully pass down such price increase
        to its customers, therefore lowering its margin.                          
        The Group’s ability to replace such suppliers may be limited and, as a result, the Group’s business, prospects, results of
        operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected. Given the above, in particular the
        limited number of suppliers that the Group relies for key elements of its operations, this risk is of material and specific
        importance the Group.                                                     
        2.2.3 The Senior Facilities Agreement includes a change of control provision which could be triggered by the Offering
              or a subsequent change of control                                   
        The Group's Senior Facilities Agreement (as defined in Section 9.4) contains a change of control provision which allows
        the lenders to require the mandatory prepayment of the Facilities in full by the Borrowers if, following a listing, the
        "Initial Investors", being ABRY Partners II, LLC and its affiliates, cease (directly or indirectly) to control more than 30%
        of the issued voting share capital of LINK Mobility Pecunia AS (formerly known as Victory Partners VIII Norway AS)
        ("LINK Pecunia"), or any person or group of persons acting in concert (other than with the Initial Investors and any
        person directly or indirectly controlled by any of them) acquires (directly or indirectly) beneficially more of the issued
        voting share capital of the LINK Pecunia than is held (directly or indirectly) in aggregate by the Initial Investors.
        Although the Group has no reason to believe that a change of control will occur under the Senior Facilities Agreement
        or that any counterparty will exercise any right to terminate a contract or otherwise trigger any change of control clause
        due to the Offering, the risk cannot be excluded. Early termination of customer contracts may increase costs, decrease
        the Group’s utilisation levels and reduce the revenue received by the Group, which could have a material adverse effect
        on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
        2.3   Risks related to financial matters and market risk                  
        2.3.1 Interest rate fluctuations could affect the Group’s cash flow and financial condition
        The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily in relation to its current and future interest bearing debt issued at
        floating interest rates. As of the date of this Prospectus, the Group’s material financing arrangements are indexed against
        EURIBOR and NIBOR. If interest rates had been one percent higher/lower and all other variables were held constant,
        the Group’s profit (and corresponding equity) for the period ended 31 December 2019 would decrease/increase by
        NOK 4.7 million. While interest rates, including the EURIBOR and NIBOR are currently at historical low levels, the Group’s
        material financial arrangements are of a long-term nature, and thus there can be no assurance that interest rates will
        not materially increase in the near future. For instance, the large fiscal stimulus employed in the European Union and
        elsewhere to combat the deceleration of economies due to COVID-19 may lead to significant inflation, which central
        banks may counter with rapid increases in interest rates. Increases in interest rates may result in an increase in the
        Group’s interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and
        hindering its growth opportunities. Consequently, material movements in interest rates could have material adverse
        effects on the Group’s cash flow and financial condition.                 
        2.3.2 Currency fluctuations could affect the Group’s cash flow and financial condition
        While the Group’s functional and operating currency is Norwegian kroner (NOK), the Group operates within, and
        generates revenue from, other jurisdictions than Norway using currencies such as Euro, Danish kroner, Swedish kroner,
        Polish zloty and Bulgarian lev. The Group does not hedge against foreign currency exposure. For the year ended
        31 December 2019, 80% of the Group’s revenue were generated in a currency other than the NOK. Based on exposure
        throughout the year and balances at the period-end, the Group assesses that fluctuations in NOK/EUR, NOK/DKK and
        NOK/SEK have the most significant impact on the financial reporting of financial assets and liabilities. See Section 11.3.8
        "Exchange rates". Consequently, the Group is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which may have an
        adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. In addition,
        as the Group reports its consolidated results in Norwegian kroners, the value of the Norwegian krone relative to its
        foreign subsidiaries’ functional currencies will affect its consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of
        financial position when those subsidiaries’ operating results are translated into Norwegian kroner for reporting purposes.
        2.3.3 The Group's complex operating history makes it difficult to evaluate and forecast the Group's future results
              of operations                                                       
        The Company was incorporated in 2018 and had no business operations before the completion of the acquisition of LINK
        Mobility Group AS in the Take-over (as defined below) in 2018. In order to present three years of operating history, the
        2017 Financial Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2018 Financial Consolidated Financial Statements prepared
        by LINK Mobility Group AS have been included in this Prospectus. The 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and the
        2018 Consolidated Financial Statements included herein do not reflect the Group’s financing arrangements because the
        borrowings under such agreements were drawn by LINK Pecunia and the costs associated with the acquisition of LINK
        Mobility Group AS by the Company (through LINK Pecunia as the bidder). Accordingly, there are limitations in the
        comparability of following line items in the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statement and the 2018 Financial Statement as
        compared to the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and the Condensed Interim Financial Statements: other
        operating expenses; depreciation and amortisation; total finance income (expense); income tax; total non-current
        assets, and total non-current liabilities. See Section 4.2.2 "Factors affecting comparability of results". Therefore, undue
        reliance should not be placed on the comparability of these line items in the Prospectus. In addition, the Group has had
        an active M&A strategy as part of its growth strategy. The M&A strategy has continued to be a key driver for growth
        under the Company's ownership. Since 2017, the Group has completed 16 strategic acquisitions. See Section 11.3.2
        "Acquisitions". These acquisitions limit the period-to-period comparability of the Consolidated Financial Statements and
        the Condensed Interim Financial Statements.                               
                                        11

        2.3.4 The Group's future results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied by the forecast of
              consolidated financial information included in this Prospectus, and investors should not place undue reliance
              on this information                                                 
        The Group’s financial outlook for the year ending 31 December 2020 and medium-to-long-term outlook included in
        Section 11.4 "The Group's 2020 outlook" in this Prospectus reflect various material assumptions some of which are
        outside management’s control, including for example that foreign exchange rates are stable in the second half of the
        year compared with the first half of the year, a stable macroeconomic situation across the Group’s footprint, and that
        no material lock-down measures are implemented in the second half of 2020. These, and the other assumptions included
        in Section 11.4 may or may not prove to be correct. The outlook has been prepared for the purpose of this Offering in
        accordance with the Group's ordinary forecasting procedures and on a basis comparable to the historical financial
        information included elsewhere in this Offering. However, the forecast of consolidated financial information are based
        on estimates made by the Group based on assumptions about future events. Certain of the assumptions, uncertainties
        and contingencies relating to the forecast of consolidated financial information and the projections of consolidated
        financial targets are wholly or partially within the Group's control, while others are outside or substantially outside of its
        control. See Section 11.4 "The Group's 2020 outlook" For example, while the Company is targeting in the long-term a
        net debt to Adjusted EBITDA below 3.0x, various factors may make such target unachievable or undesirable. In addition,
        the Group’s independent auditors have not audited, reviewed or produced the Group’s financial outlook. The Group's
        actual future results may vary from the projections contained in this Prospectus, and such variations could be material.
        Therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on this information. The outlook statements are forward looking
        statements (see Section 4.3 "Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements").
        2.3.5 Debt levels could limit the Group’s flexibility to obtain additional financing and pursue other business
              opportunities                                                       
        The Group may incur additional indebtedness in the future. This level of debt could have significant consequences for
        the Group, including (i) hindering the Group’s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital
        expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may be unavailable on favourable terms;
        (ii) the Group’s costs of borrowing could increase as it becomes more leveraged; (iii) the Group may need to use a
        substantial portion of its cash from operations to make principal and interest payments on its debt, reducing the funds
        that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and dividends to its shareholders; (iv)
        the Group’s debt level could make it more vulnerable than its competitors with less debt to competitive pressures, a
        downturn in its business or the economy generally; and (v) the Group’s debt level may limit its flexibility in responding
        to changing business and economic conditions.                             
        As of 30 June 2020, the Group's net financial indebtedness as presented in Section 9.1 "Capitalisation and indebtedness
        of the Group" was NOK 2,613.6 million. The Group’s ability to service its debt will depend upon, amongst other things,
        its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions as well as
        financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond its control. In addition, the undertakings
        included in the Senior Facilities Agreement place limits on the amount of debt the Group may incur (requiring it to
        maintain specific leverage ratios) and, subject to certain exemptions, restricts various corporate actions, such as
        restricting certain M&A activity, which is key to Group’s strategy and pay dividends. See Section 9.4.7 "Financial
        covenant", 8.4 "Strategy and objectives", Section 9.4 "Certain financing arrangements" and Section 6.2 "Constraints on
        the distribution of dividends".                                           
        If the Group’s operating income is not sufficient to service its current or future indebtedness, or if the Group is unable
        to comply with the covenants in its financial arrangements, or if uncertainties in the capital and credit markets restrict
        access to the capital required to conduct the Group’s business, the Group will be forced to take action such as reducing
        or delaying its business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or
        refinancing its debt or seeking additional equity capital, any of which could adversely impact the Group’s results of
        operations, cash flow and financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to affect
        any of these remedies on satisfactory terms, or at all.                   
        2.4   Risks relating laws, regulations and compliance                     
        2.4.1 Changes in laws and regulation may have an adverse effect on the Group’s profitability
        Compliance with the complex and changing array of laws, regulations and standards imposed on the Group’s business
        operations may require significant time, capital and operating expenditures and it impacts the manner in which the
        Group is able to provide services. For example, the Group receives, stores and processes personal information and other
        user data through its business and operations in multiple jurisdictions. This subjects the Group to data protection and
        data privacy laws and regulations, which impose stringent data protection requirements and provide high possible
        penalties for noncompliance, in particular relating to storing, sharing, using, processing, disclosing and protecting
        personal information and other user data on its platforms. Amongst others, GDPR imposes additional obligations relating
        to the maintenance of records of processing activities with respect to personal data and the ability to respond to new
        data subject rights, including for example, the "right to be forgotten" (which requires companies to permanently delete
        a user’s personal data in certain circumstances) and data portability. See Section 7.4 "Regulatory environment". Each
        of these new obligations may result in increased costs of compliance and implementation of necessary technical systems,
        which in turn could adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial
        position. For example, the Group experienced a decelerated growth rate between the second quarter 2018 and the
        second quarter 2019, which was primarily driven by GDPR implementation.   
        In addition, since 14 September 2019, compliance with the PSD2 became mandatory in the European Economic Area.
        Compliance with PSD2 may result in banks, which are important customers for LINK, deciding to use "ownership" other
        than mobile devices, such as smart cards, to authenticate payments, which may result in a decrease in the Group’s
        traffic for one-time password verification services.                      
                                        12                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        If the Group or some of its partners or suppliers are deemed to be non-compliant with the applicable laws and regulations,
        the Group could be exposed to fines and other criminal or administrative penalties, such as the withdrawal of licenses,
        and suffer reputational damages as a result. In addition to government and law enforcement action, any security breach
        or wrongful access to personal information the Group stores or processes may also subject it to legal liability to its
        customers and third parties. Furthermore, if third parties, with whom the Group works, violate applicable laws or the
        Group’s policies, such violations may also put the Group’s customers’ information at risk and could have an adverse
        effect on the Group's customers' business and expose it to financial liability. Each of these factors could harm the Group’s
        business reputation and have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and
        financial position. Given the above, in particular the scale of the Group’s operations and the complexity of these
        regulations as applicable to the Group’s operations, this risk is of material and specific importance the Group.
        2.4.2 Tax matters, including changes to tax laws, regulations and treaties, could impact the Group’s business,
              financial condition and results of operations                       
        The Group operates in different countries and its earnings are subject to taxation in different jurisdictions and at different
        rates, including but not limited to corporation tax, income tax, value added tax, social security and other payroll related
        taxes. Changes in tax laws and regulations, international treaties and tax accounting standards and/or uncertainty over
        their application and interpretation or new challenges by tax or competition authorities, as well as changes in the
        geographic mix of the Group’s profits may adversely affect its results (notably its tax expense) and its effective tax rate.
        An adverse change in the taxes to which the Group is subject could have a material adverse effect on its business,
        prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For instance, the implementation of ATAD and ATAD
        2 (which introduced among other matters, limitations on interest deductibility and anti-hybrid tax mismatches) in the
        countries in which we operate may result in increases to Group’s overall tax liability. As of the date of the Prospectus,
        the overall impact of ATAD and ATAD 2 cannot yet be determined.           
        Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors on the impact of these changes prior to making an investment
        decision in respect of the Shares. Given the large number of jurisdictions in which the Group operates, as well as the
        Group’s growth strategy and the complexity of these laws and regulations as applicable to the Group’s operations, this
        risk is of material and specific importance the Group.                    
        2.4.3 The Group is exposed to significant risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations
              and economic sanctions programs                                     
        Operating an international business requires the Group to comply with the laws and regulations of various jurisdictions..
        In particular, the Group’s international operations are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S.
        Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 ("FCPA") and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, and economic sanctions
        programs, including those administered by the United Nations, the European Union and the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets
        Control. These anti-corruption laws and regulations comprehensively and, in some cases, in differing ways, cover many
        forms of public and private corruption. As part of its business, the Group may deal with both governments and state-
        owned business enterprises, the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA and other
        applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations. Economic sanctions programs restrict the Group’s business dealings with
        certain sanctioned countries, and new sanctions programs may be imposed, or existing sanctions programs revised in
        unpredictable ways depending on circumstances outside of the Group’s control.
        The Group is also exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those
        countries in which it operates. The Group has completed 16 M&A transactions since 2017, some in countries with a lower
        score than Scandinavia in the Corruption Perceptions Index. The Group’s continued expansion and its development of
        relationships with third parties worldwide increase the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, sanctions regulations or
        similar laws. Violations of anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines,
        denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts (and termination of
        existing contracts) and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. In addition,
        any major violations could have a significant impact on the Group’s reputation and consequently on its ability to win
        future business. In certain circumstances, strict compliance with antibribery laws and reporting obligations may conflict
        with local customs and practices. In addition, the Group makes use of third-parties, also in high-risk markets, which
        pose an inherent risk to strict compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.
        In recent years, enforcement of these laws and regulations has become more stringent, resulting in several landmark
        fines and reputational damage. Given the large number of jurisdictions in which the Group operates (including certain
        high-risk markets), the volume of customers that contract with the Group, its expansion plans, as well as the increased
        rate of prosecution of the relevant authorities for violations of these laws and regulations, this risk is of material and
        specific importance the Group, and the Group could be subject to penalties and suffer material adverse consequences
        on its business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
        2.5   Risks relating to the Shares                                        
        2.5.1 The price of the Shares may fluctuate significantly, which could cause investors to lose a significant part of
              their investment                                                    
        The Offer Price may not be indicative for the market price of the Shares after the Offering has been completed. The
        trading price of the Shares could fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors beyond the Group’s control,
        including quarterly variations in operating results, adverse business developments, adverse market conditions (including,
        but not limited to, as a consequence of COVID-19), changes in financial estimates and investment recommendations or
        ratings by securities analysts, announcements by the Group or its competitors of new product and service offerings,
        significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic relationships, publicity about the Group, its products and services or its
        competitors, lawsuits against the Group, unforeseen liabilities, changes in management, changes to the regulatory
        environment in which it operates or general market conditions.            
                                        13                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        In addition, in recent years, the Oslo Stock Exchange has experienced wide price and volume fluctuations. For instance,
        the Oslo Børs All Share Index, which consists of all shares listed on Oslo Børs, decreased by approximately 33%, 17%
        and 11% between 21 February 2020 and 15 March 2020, 29 September 2018 and 27 December 2018, and 4 January
        2016 and 21 January 2016. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many
        companies. Those changes may occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies. The Company
        cannot assure that the market price of the Shares will not decline, and the Shares may trade at prices significantly below
        the Offer Price, regardless of the Group’s actual operating performance.  
        2.5.2 Future sales, or the possibility for future sales, including by existing shareholders, of substantial number of
              shares may affect the Shares’ market price                          
        The market price of the Shares could decline as a result of sales of a large number of Shares in the market or the
        perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, might also make it
        more difficult for the Company to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that it deems appropriate.
        The Company cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales of the Shares, or the availability of Shares for future sales,
        will have on their market price. In particular, even assuming full exercise of the Over-allotment Option, Victory Partners
        VIII Limited will continue to hold approximately 35% of the Shares after the completion of the Offering. If Victory
        Partners VIII Limited were to sale their Shares in large quantities after the Offering, or there were a perception that this
        may happen in the foreseeable future, the market price of the Shares could materially decline.
        2.6   Risks relating to the Offering and the Listing                      
        2.6.1 Following the Offering, Victory Partners VIII Limited will continue to be a large shareholder and may control
              or otherwise influence important actions the Group takes            
        Upon the completion of the Offering, Victory Partners VIII Limited will continue to be the largest shareholder of the
        Company. Victory Partners VIII Limited will be in a position to exercise considerable influence over all matters requiring
        shareholder approval. These matters include the authorization of any proposed capital increase and profit distribution,
        corporate mergers and sales involving all or nearly all of the Group's assets. Victory Partners VIII Limited may also be
        able to influence the direction of the Group’s operations and other affairs through its representation on the Board of
        Directors. This concentration of share ownership could have the effect of delaying, postponing or preventing a change
        of control in the Company, and impact mergers, consolidations, acquisitions or other forms of combinations, which may
        or may not be desired by other shareholders. No assurances can be given that the interests of Victory Partners VIII
        Limited or the investors who directly or indirectly control Victory Partners VIII Limited will not differ from the interests
        of other shareholders.                                                    
        The interests of Victory Partners VIII Limited may not be aligned with the interests of minority shareholders with respect
        to such voting decisions. In addition, Victory Partners VIII Limited's share ownership may materially adversely affect the
        trading price of the Shares because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with a
        significant shareholder.                                                  
        2.6.2 The Shares are listed on an "if issued/if sold" basis until delivery of the Shares, which could result in all
              conditional trades being reversed                                   
        The Shares are expected to be listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on an "if issued/if sold" basis. Therefore, the Shares
        will be tradable on the Oslo Stock Exchange before the Shares are delivered to each investor. If the Underwriting
        Agreement is terminated due to certain force majeure events, or if there is a default by Managers in certain
        circumstances, the Shares will not be delivered to the investors. All prior trades with the Shares will be cancelled and
        reversed, and any payments made will be returned without interest or other compensation. Such events could adversely
        affect participants in the Offering and those who trade in the Shares during the period of conditional trading. The
        Managers, the Company and the Selling Shareholders do not accept any responsibility or liability for any loss incurred
        by any person as a result of a termination of the Offering or (the related) annulment of any transactions on the Oslo
        Stock Exchange during the period of conditional trading.                  
        2.6.3 Although the Company does not expect to be a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal
              income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be a PFIC for any taxable year,
              which could subject United States investors in the Shares to significant adverse U.S. federal income tax
              consequences                                                        
        The Company does not expect to be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the current taxable year or in the
        foreseeable future. However, whether the Company is a PFIC will be determined annually based upon the composition
        and nature of its income, and the composition, nature and valuation of its assets (including goodwill), all of which are
        subject to change (including in the current taxable year). The composition and valuation of the Company’s assets may
        be determined in large part by reference to the market value of the Shares, which may be volatile. The determination
        of whether the Company is a PFIC will also depend upon the application of complex U.S. federal income tax rules
        concerning the classification of the Company’s assets (including goodwill) and income for this purpose, and the
        application of these rules is uncertain in some respects. Accordingly no assurance can be provided that the IRS will not
        successfully assert that the Company has been or will be a PFIC for the current year or any subsequent taxable year for
        U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company will not provide annual determinations regarding its PFIC status for any
        taxable year.                                                             
        If the Company is classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder (as defined in "United States Federal
        Income Tax Considerations") holds the Shares, such U.S. Holder may incur significantly increased U.S. federal income
        tax on gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of the Shares and on the receipt of certain distributions on the
        Shares. See the discussion under "United States Federal Income Tax Considerations — Passive Foreign Investment
        Company Rules" concerning the U.S. federal income tax considerations of owning and disposing of the Shares if the
        Company is or becomes classified as a PFIC, including the possibility of making certain elections.

        This Prospectus has been prepared in connection with the Offering described herein and listing of the Shares on the Oslo
        Stock Exchange.                                                           
        The Board of Directors of LINK Mobility Group Holding ASA accepts responsibility for the information contained in this
        Prospectus. The members of the Board of Directors confirm that, after having taken all reasonable care to ensure that
        such is the case, the information contained in this Prospectus is, to the best of their knowledge, in accordance with the
        facts and contains no omission likely to affect its import.

        This Prospectus has been approved by the Norwegian FSA, as competent authority under the EU Prospectus Regulation.
        The Norwegian FSA only approves this Prospectus as meeting the standards of completeness, comprehensibility and
        consistency imposed by the EU Prospectus Regulation, and such approval should not be considered as an endorsement
        of the issuer or the quality of the securities that are the subject of this Prospectus. Investors should make their own
        assessment as to the suitability of investing in the securities.          
        The Company has provided the information in this Prospectus. The Managers make no representation or warranty,
        express or implied, as to the accuracy, completeness or verification of the information set forth herein, and nothing
        contained in this Prospectus is, or shall be relied upon, as a promise or representation in this respect, whether as to the
        past or the future. The Managers disclaim, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all liability whether
        arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which they might otherwise be found to have in respect of this Prospectus or any
        such statement.                                                           
        The Managers are acting exclusively for the Company and the Selling Shareholders and no one else in connection with
        the Offering. They will not regard any other person (whether or not a recipient of this document) as their respective
        clients in relation to the Offering and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Company and the Selling
        Shareholders for providing the protections afforded to their respective clients nor for giving advice in relation to the
        Offering or any transaction or arrangement referred to herein.            
        The information contained herein is current as of the date hereof and subject to change, completion and amendment

        or material inaccuracies relating to the information included in this Prospectus, which may affect the assessment of the
        Offer Shares and which arises or is noted between the time when the Prospectus is approved by the Norwegian FSA and
        the listing of the Shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange, will be mentioned in a supplement to this Prospectus without undue
        delay. Neither the publication nor distribution of this Prospectus, nor the sale of any Offer Shares, shall under any
        circumstance imply that there has not been any change in the Group's affairs or that the information herein is correct

        or by any of the affiliates, representatives, advisers or selling agents of any of the foregoing.
        Neither the Company, the Selling Shareholders or the Managers, or any of their respective affiliates, representatives,
        advisers or selling agents, is making any representation, express or implied, to any offeree or purchaser of the Offer
        Shares regarding the legality of an investment in the Offer Shares. Each investor should consult with his or her own

        than in connection with the Offering. Accordingly, references in the Prospectus to Offer Shares being offered or placed
        should be read as including any offering or placement of Offer Shares to any of the Managers or any of their respective
        affiliates acting in such capacity. In addition, certain of the Managers or their affiliates may enter into financing
        arrangements (including swaps) with investors in connection with which such Managers (or their affiliates) may from
        time to time acquire, hold or dispose of Shares. None of the Managers intends to disclose the extent of any such
        investment or transactions otherwise than in accordance with any legal or regulatory obligation to do so.

        this methodology, the comparative information presented in 2018 is not restated.

        4.2.2 Factors affecting comparability of results                          
        4.2.2.1 Introduction                                                      
        In July 2018, a voluntary take-over offer was launched by the Company (formerly known as Victory Partners VIII Norway
        Holding AS) through its subsidiary, LINK Pecunia (formerly known as Victory Partners VIII Norway AS), to acquire 100%
        of the shares in LINK Mobility Group AS (the "Take-over"). Following completion of the Take-over, the Company
        controlled 100% of the shares in LINK Mobility Group AS through LINK Pecunia and became the new parent company of
        the Group.                                                                
        The Company was incorporated in May 2018 in connection with the Take-over. The Company has prepared annual
        financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2019. As the Take-over was completed in October
        2018, the Company's annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2018 only cover the operations of the Group
        from 9 October 2018 to and as of 31 December 2018.                        
        To provide comparable figures for the Group's operation, the Prospectus presents the 2017 Consolidated Financial
        Statements and the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements prepared by Link Mobility Group AS, a wholly owned
        subsidiary by the Company (see Section 13.2 "Legal structure").           
        4.2.2.2 Limitation on comparability of results – The Company versus Link Mobility Group AS
        The 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements included herein do not
        reflect the Group’s financing arrangements associated with the acquisition of Link Mobility Group AS, because the
        borrowings under such agreements were drawn by LINK Pecunia, a wholly owned subsidiary by the Company (see
        Section 9.4 "Certain financing arrangements").                            
        Further, the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements included herein
        do not reflect the effects of the Company’s purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition of Link Mobility
        Group AS in October 2018, performed by the Company.                       
        As such, the main differences between the consolidated financial information of the Company and Link Mobility Group
        AS’ statement of financial position are higher non-current assets in the Company mainly attributable to recognition of
        Goodwill and other intangible assets as part of the purchase price allocation in connection with the acquisition of Link
        Mobility Group AS as well as higher non-current liabilities in the Company due to the borrowing held at Company level
        in connection with the refinancing of Link Mobility Group AS and increasing its borrowings through the Senior Facilities
        Agreement. In addition, total equity is also affected because of the differences in the legal structures of the Company
        and Link Mobility Group AS, as well as tax positions mainly due to the items described herein.
        The main differences between the consolidated financial information of the Company and Link Mobility Group AS’ income
        statements are higher amortisation in the Company due to the effects of the recognition of other intangible assets as
        part of the purchase price allocation in connection with the acquisition of Link Mobility Group AS as well as higher net
        finance expenses in the Company due to the interests on the Senior Facilities Agreement as well as foreign exchange
        gain and losses related to the tranches of the Senior Facilities Agreements denominated in EUR.
        Therefore, undue reliance should not be placed on the comparability of these line items in the Prospectus. See Section
        11 "Operating and financial review". For description of impact on the line items, see Section 11.8 "Comparison of results
        for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to 31 December 2018".
        In addition, the Group has had an active M&A strategy as part of its growth strategy. The M&A strategy has continued
        to be a key driver for growth under the Company’s ownership. Since 2017 the Group has completed 16 strategic
        acquisitions. See Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions". These acquisitions limit the period-to-period comparability of the
        Consolidated Financial Statements and the Condensed Interim Financial Statements. See Section 2.3.3 "The Group's
        complex operating history makes it difficult to evaluate and forecast the Group's future results of operations".

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        4.2.3 Non-IFRS financial measures                                         
        In this Prospectus, the Group presents certain alternative performance measures ("APMs"), including Churn Rate, Gross
        Profit, Gross Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Profit Conversion,
        Revenue Net Retention Rate and Like-for-Like Revenue. The APMs presented herein are not measurements of financial
        performance or liquidity under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, are not audited and investors
        should not consider any such measures to be an alternative to (a) operating revenues or operating profit (as determined
        in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), (b) as a measure of the Group's operating performance;
        or (c) any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. The APMs presented herein
        may not be indicative of the Group's historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of the
        Group's future results.                                                   
        The Group believes that APMs are commonly reported by companies in the markets in which it competes and are widely
        used by investors in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to factors such as depreciation and
        amortisation, which can vary significantly, depending upon accounting methods (particularly when acquisitions have
        occurred) or based on non-operating factors. Accordingly, the Group discloses Churn Rate, Gross Profit, Gross Margin,
        EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Profit Conversion, Revenue Net
        Retention Rate and Like-for-Like Revenue herein to permit a more complete and comprehensive analysis of its underlying
        operating performance relative to other companies and across periods, and of the Group's ability to service its debt.
        Because companies may calculate Churn Rate, Gross Profit, Gross Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
        Margin, LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Profit Conversion, Revenue Net Retention Rate and Like-for-Like Revenue
        differently, the Group's presentation of these APMs may not be comparable to similar titled measures used by other
        companies.                                                                
        The Group defines "Churn Rate" as revenue of customers that were a customer in the prior period but were not a
        customer at the beginning of the current period divided by the total revenue of the prior period.
        The group defines "Gross Profit" as revenue less direct costs of services rendered.
        The Group defines "Gross Margin" as revenue less direct costs divided by revenue.
        The Group defines "EBITDA" as operating profit (loss) adding back depreciation and amortisation.
        The Group defines "Adjusted EBITDA" as EBITDA adjusted for mergers and acquisitions costs, restructuring costs and
        costs related to share option program.                                    
        The Group defines "Adjusted EBITDA Margin" as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of operating revenues in the
        respective periods.                                                       
        The Group defines "Like-for-Like Revenue" as revenue recorded in an audited or reviewed period excluding the
        revenue from acquired entities in such period.                            
        The Group defined "LTM Adjusted EBITDA" as Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months from the end of the period
        The Group defines "Gross Profit Conversion" as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Gross Profit.
        The Group defines "Net Customer Expansion Rate" as the revenue generated from customers at the end of the period
        with their corresponding revenue from the same period in the previous year.
        The Group defines "Revenue Net Retention Rate" as revenue from the net of upsale, downsale and churn for
        customers throughout the period, not taking into account new customers during the period. Revenue Net Retention Rate
        excludes the acquisitions of TeraComm Group and Spothit.                  
        For an overview of reconciliation and calculation of the relevant APMs, please see Section 10.7 "Non-IFRS financial
        measures".                                                                
        4.2.4 Industry and market data                                            
        This Prospectus contains statistics, data, statements and other information relating to markets, market sizes, market
        shares, market positions and other industry data pertaining to the Group’s business and the industries and markets in
        which it operates. Unless otherwise indicated, such information reflects the Group’s estimates based on analysis of
        multiple sources, including data compiled by professional organisations, consultants and analysts and information
        otherwise obtained from other third party sources, such as annual and interim financial statements and other
        presentations published by listed companies operating within the same industry as the Group, as well as the Group’s
        internal data and its own experience, or on a combination of the foregoing. Unless otherwise indicated in the Prospectus,
        the basis for any statements regarding the Group’s competitive position is based on the Company’s own assessment and
        knowledge of the market in which it operates.                             
        The Company confirms that where information has been sourced from a third party, such information has been accurately
        reproduced and that as far as the Company is aware and is able to ascertain from information published by that third
        party, no facts have been omitted that would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Where
        information sourced from third parties has been presented, the source of such information has been identified. The
        Company does not intend, and does not assume any obligations to update industry or market data set forth in this
        Prospectus.                                                               
        Industry publications or reports generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources

        independently verified and cannot give any assurances as to the accuracy of market data contained in this Prospectus
        that was extracted from these industry publications or reports and reproduced herein. Market data and statistics are
        inherently predictive and subject to uncertainty and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics
        are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and
        the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant
        market.                                                                   
        As a result, prospective investors should be aware that statistics, data, statements and other information relating to
        markets, market sizes, market shares, market positions and other industry data in this Prospectus and projections,
        assumptions and estimates based on such information may not be reliable indicators of the Group’s future performance
        and the future performance of the industry in which it operates. Such indicators are necessarily subject to a high degree
        of uncertainty and risk due to the limitations described above and to a variety of other factors, including those described
        in Section 2 "Risk factors" and elsewhere in this Prospectus.

        amount presented.

        4.3   Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements                
        This Prospectus includes forward-looking statements that reflect the Group’s current intentions, beliefs or current
        expectations concerning, among other things, financial position, operating results, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies
        and the industries and markets in which the Group operates ("Forward-looking Statements"). These forward-looking
        statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms "anticipates", "assumes",
        "believes", "can", "could", "estimates", "expects", "forecasts", "intends", "may", "might", "plans", "projects", "should",
        "will", "would" or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology. Forward-looking
        statements as a general matter are all statements other than statements as to historic facts or present facts or
        circumstances. They appear in a number of places throughout this Prospectus, and include, among other things,
        statements relating to the Group’s strategy, outlook and growth prospects and the ability of the Group to implement its
        strategic initiatives, the Group’s financial condition, the Group’s working capital, cash flows and capital investments, the
        impact of regulation on the Group, general economic trends and trends in the Group’s industries and markets and the
        competitive environment in which the Group operates. The Group's financial outlook for the year ending 31 December
        2020 included in Section 11.4 "The Group's 2020 outlook" contains forward-looking statements as defined in the EU
        Prospectus Regulation.                                                    
        The Group's 2020 Outlook (in Section 11.4) was not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines
        of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
        Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information.
        Prospective investors in the Shares are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
        performance and that the Group’s actual financial position, operating results and liquidity, and the development of the
        industries and markets in which the Group operates, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the
        forward-looking statements contained in this Prospectus. The Group can provide no assurances that the intentions,
        beliefs or current expectations upon which its forward-looking statements are based will occur.
        Although the Group believes that the expectations implied by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, the
        Group can give no assurances that the outcomes contemplated will materialise or prove to be correct. By their nature,
        forward-looking statements involve and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions as they
        relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Because of these known and
        unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, outcomes may differ materially from those set out in any forward-looking
        statement. Important factors that could cause those differences include, but are not limited to:
               The Group’s international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business internationally;
               The Group may experience operational problems, business interruption or cyberattacks that reduce
                revenue, increase costs and adversely affect the Group’s reputation;
               Changes in laws and regulation may have an adverse effect on the Group’s profitability. In addition, failure
                to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other
                matters, including the GDPR, could result in liability, harm the Group’s reputation and have a material
                adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations;
               The markets in which the Group competes in are undergoing rapid technological change, and the Group’s
                future success will depend on its ability to meet the changing needs and expectations of its customers;
               The Group faces risks of claims for intellectual property infringement; and
               The Group may be unable to attract and retain key management personnel and other employees, which
                may negatively impact the effectiveness of the Group’s management and results of operations.
        Additional factors that could cause the Group’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially include,
        but are not limited to, those discussed under Section 1 "Summary", Section 2 "Risk factors", Section 6 "Dividends and
        dividend policy", Section 7.4 "Regulatory environment", Section 8 "Business of the Group " and Section 11 "Operating
        and financial review". Prospective investors in the Shares are urged to read all Sections of this Prospectus and, in
        particular, Section 2 "Risk factors" for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect the Group’s future
        performance and the industry in which the Group operates when considering an investment in the Company.
        These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Prospectus. Save as required by Article 23 of the EU
        Prospectus Regulation or by other applicable law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or
        publicly revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All
        subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Group or to persons acting on the Group’s
        behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere
        in this Prospectus.                                                       
        Given the afore-mentioned uncertainties, prospective investors are urged not to place undue reliance on any of the

        profile, and provide improved access to public capital markets and a diversified base of local and international
        shareholders. The Company believes that these factors will further enhance its competitive position, in relation to other
        technology companies, and provide the appropriate platform for the Group's future development.
        The net proceeds from the Offering are, assuming a sale of the maximum number of New Shares at the Offer Price,
        estimated to amount to approximately NOK 2.36 billion (after deduction of costs and expenses payable by the Company,
        as estimated under Section 17.16 "Expenses of the Offering and the Listing"). The Company currently intends to use
        approximately NOK 1.8 billion of the net proceeds of the Offering to repay debt, of which approximately NOK 1.4 billion
        will constitute mandatory pre-payment under the Senior Facilities Agreement and approximately NOK 0.41 billion will be
        payment of the outstanding redemption amount relating to the redeemed preference shares. The remaining net proceeds
        will be used to finance the Group's growth strategy, including acquisitions, investments in go-to-market initiative and
        continuing expansion of the CPaaS platform. The Groups capitalisation and indebtedness is described in Section 9.1
        "Capitalisation and indebtedness of the Group". For more information on the Company's growth strategy see Section 8.4
        "Strategy and objectives".                                                
        As of the date of this Prospectus, the Company cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds
        from the Offering, or the amounts that it will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The Company will at its
        discretion decide on the amounts and timing of the Company's actual expenditures, which will depend upon numerous
        factors, including the evolution of the Company's debt ratio, availability of appropriate investment opportunities, the
        ability to reach an agreement on suitable terms with potential sellers or providers, the net proceeds actually raised in
        the Offering and the Company's operating costs and expenditures. Accordingly, the Company's management will have
        significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the Offering.     
        The Group will not receive any part of the proceeds from the sale of any Sale Shares sold by the Selling Shareholders,
        including any proceeds from Lending Selling Shareholders' sale of Shares under the Over-Allotment Option.

        6     DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND POLICY                                       
        6.1   Dividend policy                                                     
        In deciding whether to propose a dividend and in determining the dividend amount, the Company’s Board of Directors
        will take into account legal restrictions, as set out in the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act (see Section 6.2
        "Constraints on the distribution of dividends"), the Company’s capital requirements, including capital expenditure
        requirements, its financial condition, general business conditions and any restrictions that its credit agreements or other
        contractual arrangements in place at the time of the dividend may place on its ability to pay dividends and the
        maintaining of appropriate financial flexibility. Except in certain specific and limited circumstances set out in the
        Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act, the amount of dividends paid may not exceed the amount recommended by
        the Board of Directors.                                                   
        As of the date of this Prospectus the Company has not paid any dividends. The Company’s dividend policy is that the
        Company does not expect to pay any dividend in the short to medium term as the Company intends to use its profit for
        both organic and inorganic growth initiatives as well as product and technology innovation.
        6.2   Constraints on the distribution of dividends                        
        Dividends may be paid in cash or in some instances in kind. The Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act provides the
        following constraints on the distribution of dividends applicable to the Company:
                   Section 8-1 of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act provides that the Company
                    may distribute dividend to the extent that the Company’s net assets following the distribution
                    covers (i) the share capital, (ii) the reserve for valuation variances and (iii) the reserve for
                    unrealised gains. The Company’s total nominal value of treasury shares which the Company has
                    acquired for ownership or security prior to the balance sheet date, as well as credit and security
                    which, pursuant to Section 8-7 to Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act fall
                    within the limits of distributable equity, shall be deducted from the distributable amount.
                   The calculation of the distributable equity shall be made on the basis of the balance sheet in the
                    approved annual accounts for the last financial year, but so that the registered share capital as of
                    the date of the resolution to distribute dividend shall apply. Following the approval of the annual
                    accounts for the last financial year, the General Meeting may also authorise the Board of Directors
                    to declare dividend on the basis of the Company’s annual accounts.
                   Dividend may also be distributed by the General Meeting based on an interim balance sheet which
                    has been prepared and audited in accordance with the provisions applying to the annual accounts
                    and with a balance sheet date not further into the past than six months before the date of the
                    General Meeting’s resolution.                                 
                   Divided can only be distributed to the extent that the Company’s equity and liquidity following the
                    distribution is considered sound.                             
        The Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act does not provide for any time limit after which entitlement to dividends
        lapses. Subject to various exceptions, Norwegian law provides a limitation period of three years from the date on which
        an obligation is due. There are no dividend restrictions or specific procedures for non-Norwegian resident shareholders
        to claim dividends. For a description of withholding tax on dividends applicable to non-Norwegian residents, see Section
        16 "Taxation".                                                            
        The Senior Facilities Agreement (as defined in Section 9.4 "Certain financing arrangements") contains restrictions on the
        ability by LINK Pecunia (formerly known Victory Partners VIII Norway AS), the Company's direct subsidiary, and certain
        of its subsidiaries to declare or pay any dividends or make any other distribution or pay any interest or other amounts
        on or in respect of its share capital or any class of its share capital (together, for the purposes of this paragraph, a
        "dividend"), in each case until the Senior Facilities Agreement has been repaid in full, except for: (i) payment of a
        dividend by a subsidiary of LINK Pecunia to its direct shareholders either pro rata to their shareholdings or to LINK
        Pecunia or its subsidiaries; (ii) payment of a dividend by certain permitted joint ventures (as described in the Senior
        Facilities Agreement) in accordance with its joint venture agreements; (iii) certain payments otherwise described in and
        permitted by the Senior Facilities Agreement; and (iv) payments made as a result of certain transactions described in
        and permitted by the Senior Facilities Agreement.                         
        6.3   Manner of dividend payment                                          
        Any future payments of dividends on the shares will be made in the currency of the bank account of the relevant
        shareholder registered with the VPS and will be paid to the shareholders through the VPS. Shareholders registered in
        the VPS who have not supplied the VPS with details of their bank account, will not receive payment of dividends unless
        they register their bank account details with Danske Bank, and transfer fees may apply for payments made in such
        manner. The exchange rate(s) that is applied will be Danske Bank’s rate on the date of issuance. Dividends will be
        credited automatically to the VPS registered shareholders' accounts, or in lieu of such registered account, at the time
        when the shareholder has provided the Danske Bank with their bank account details. Shareholders' right to payment of
        dividend will lapse three years following the resolved payment date for those shareholders who have not registered their
        bank account details with the Danske Bank.                                
                                        24

        7     INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW                                        
        7.1   Introduction                                                        
        The mobile messaging market began in the early 1990’s with the development of SMS technology. The SMS transformed
        the way in which people communicate as the ease of use was significantly improved compared to other communication
        methods. Furthermore, the broader global digitalisation mega trend has also driven changes in communication
        preferences and consumer behaviour across industries and processes. Communication has shifted from offline to online
        and several aspects of the two-way dialogue between enterprises and consumers have transitioned to direct mobile
        communication. Therefore, as digitalisation continues to evolve, messaging is increasingly becoming an indispensable
        part of consumer and business communication. This is illustrated by consumers’ preference for messaging over other
        communication methods. According to a Sentinent Decision Science Survey from 2018, 58% of people would choose
        messaging over making a telephone call and 55% of people would choose messaging to sending an email. Consumer
        also want to message businesses across the entire customer journey, starting from making general enquiries prior to a
        purchase, while making the purchase itself, to commenting about a product post-purchase. Brands need to adopt
        messaging to better communicate with their customers, because according to a 2017 survey by Lawless Research,
        although 8/10 businesses believe they are communicating effectively with their customers, only 2/10 customers agree.
        Brands are therefore focusing on continuously enhancing the customer journey and migrating to a mobile first approach.
        Similarly, businesses are also changing how their employees communicate and collaborate in order to increase efficiency,
        and messaging is therefore becoming increasingly important for internal business communications as well.
        7.2   Messaging and Communication Platform as a Service (CPaaS) market outlook
        7.2.1 Messaging market                                                    
        Today, most of the mobile messaging services are dominated by SMS technology. Upon the emergence of Application-
        to-person ("A2P") messaging, SMS was the only viable messaging channel for businesses to reach their customers, and
        SMS continues to account for most of the messaging traffic and revenue to date. This is due to SMS’s universal reach,
        with more than 4bn frequent users worldwide and ubiquity on smartphones. With a 98% read rate, and 90% of messages
        read within 3 minutes, SMS is considered as a highly reliable channel (Source: Mobile Marketing Association).
        Furthermore, better security features due to delivery through MNO infrastructure, many deem SMS as the preferred
        channel for mission-critical messages. For example, many enterprises and governments preferred to communicate
        important announcements during the COVID-19 pandemic via SMS.             
        The mobile messaging market is a large and growing market. The use of CPaaS solutions has expanded to new markets
        such as banking, healthcare, e-commerce, transportation, travel and retail. Juniper Research anticipates that total
        operator messaging revenues will grow at a 10% CAGR between 2020 and 2023, exceeding USD 62 billion by 2023
        (Source: Juniper Research, 2019). This growth is a conservative estimate in that it excludes the revenue attributed to
        Over-the-Top ("OTT") channels, as these are not captured by operator revenues. The key growth drivers for the overall
        mobile messaging market include (i) consumer’s increased preference for messaging (ii) the emergence of OTT channels
        and (iii) new features, such as rich content, driving increased consumer engagement with brands and new use cases.
        The chart below shows the expected growth for the global A2P messaging market and the rising adoption of OTT
        messages as a percentage of total messaging volume.

                          A2P SMS  RCS    OTT as % of Total Message Volume        
        The use of OTT messaging platforms has risen drastically in the past few years, with consumers being active across a
        plethora of messaging and media channels, such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat and other social media.
        The OTT market is highly fragmented and characterised by different penetration rates across geographies and serving
        different purposes for consumers. Although the use of OTT channels have initially been centred around Person-to-Person
        ("P2P") messages, in recent years, an increasing number of messaging platforms have opened to allow enterprises to
        interact directly with their consumers through these channels (e.g., WhatsApp Business, Apple Business Chat, Viber
                                        25                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        Business, WeChat Business). According to Juniper Research, OTT is expected to grow at a 70% CAGR between 2020 and
        2023, making up 5% of total messaging volume by 2023 (Source: Juniper Research, 2019). The accommodation of
        business communication by these channels has significant benefits for enterprises as it facilitates access to these
        channels’ large and growing user bases, whilst consumers benefit from receiving content through their preferred channel
        of communication.                                                         
        Technological advancements including Rich Communication Services ("RCS"), whereby rich content can be embedded
        in messages, customised messages that are tailored to the consumer, and two-way conversational enterprise messages
        have significantly expanded the number of use cases and new solutions for mobile messages. With Google’s official
        backing of RCS in 2017, this technology is expected to gain traction and will begin to accumulate traffic share as operators
        and handset support increases. RCS has significant potential, considering the revenues that operators can achieve
        through implementation of the technology compared to the minimal investment needed to support it, with an anticipated
        CAGR of 434% between 2020 and 2023 (Source: Juniper Research, 2019).      
        7.2.2 CPaaS market                                                        
        At its core, CPaaS provides the engine behind enterprise communication services. CPaaS offers a cloud-based multi-
        layered middleware on which communications software can be developed, run and distributed. The platform offers
        APIs/integrated development environments that simplify the integration of communications capabilities into applications,
        services or business processes. The global CPaaS market is expected to grow rapidly from USD 6 billion in 2020 to
        USD 18 billion in 2024, representing a CAGR of 33% (Source: IDC Worldwide, 2020). The need for enterprises to provide
        enhanced end-user customer experiences is driving the high CPaaS growth, which is underpinned by enterprises adopting
        embedded, real-time messaging communications for enhanced end-user customer-interfacing interactions. The
        increasing complexity driven by the growth of channels, technological advancement of messaging features and the high
        cost of developing an in-house infrastructure, is causing enterprises to turn to CPaaS providers instead. By leveraging
        CPaaS, enterprises benefit from not having to pay expensive up-front development costs, pay only for what they
        consume, and have access to a flexible and scalable platform that can reach consumers across multiple channels. The
        chart below shows the expected growth for the global CPaaS market.

        7.3   Competitive overview                                                
        The Group has a large variety of competitors. Overall, the European market for B2C mobile services is fragmented with
        many small and mid-size local/national providers in addition to some lager international players. LINK has during the
        last years become a major player in the European Market. With 29 offices (24 offices with more than two employees and
        five offices with two employees) across 17 countries in Europe, LINK has a comprehensive local presence in the markets
        in which it operates, with local offices that work closely with local customers in order to provide complete mobile solutions
        for all local businesses, public services and organisations. Such local presence, combined with the variety of products
        and solutions that LINK offers to its customers, provides LINK with a competitive advantage over its competitors. There
        are many smaller local providers that offer various mobile services in each of the markets, and there are some
        international players that offers more general large-scale mobile messaging services (SMS bulk) in all of the markets.
        The Group competes in markets that are competitive, fragmented and rapidly changing and the Group expects to
        continue to experience competition from current and potential competitors. The principal competitive factors in this
        market include: completeness of offering, credibility with developers, global reach, ease of integration, product features,
        platform scalability, brand reputation and awareness, customer support, and the cost of deployment of product offerings.
        The Issuer believes that the Group competes favourably within each of these categories.
        The industry is characterized by high barriers to entry. Specifically, building out a connectivity network combining both
        global telecom operators and OTT messaging channels is difficult to replicate. Negotiating competitive rates with
        messaging providers requires substantial scale, know-how and embedded market positioning. Winning over enterprise
        customers to deliver mission critical components of their day-to-day operations requires substantial expertise, depth of
        solutions, track record and execution at scale.                           
                                        26                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        The Group competes with several vendors across its various product lines, including:
                                                                                  
              •     Direct local competitors;                                     
              •     Direct international competitors, such as CLX Communications AB (d/b/a Sinch), Infobip, Twilio
                    Inc., MessageBird, IMI Mobile, Commifyor and CM.com;          
                                                                                  
              •     Smaller software companies that compete with certain portions of the Group’s communications
                    services offerings; and                                       
              •     SaaS companies that offer pre-packaged applications for a narrow set of use cases.
        The Group may face increasing competition from new market entrants that are not currently present or not materially
        present in the Group’s markets. The Group also faces competition from alternative channels such as application
        notifications, where the Group’s market share and product range is lower and smaller.
        Given the Group’s size and financial condition, certain competitors may be able offer more aggressive contractual terms
        or compete on pricing in a manner that the Group is not willing or able to match on a sustained basis, which may affect
        its ability to obtain new business or retain its current customers. If, for instance, a new large multinational competitor
        with sufficient funding and a limited need to be profitable in the medium term were to enter any of the Group’s markets,
        this could be highly disruptive to the Group.                             
        7.4   Regulatory environment                                              
        The Group is subject to a number of EU and local laws and regulations that involve matters central to its business. These
        laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection,
        export taxation or other subjects. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain,
        particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which the Group operates. Because global laws and regulations
        have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that it or its communications services or its Platform may
        not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.
        In addition, as the Group expands internationally, it will be subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which it
        offers services. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the EU member states and the UK, have laws
        and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information (PII) obtained from individuals
        located in the EU or in the UK or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction, and regulations in these jurisdictions
        apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of PII that identifies or may be used to identify an
        individual, such as names, telephone numbers, message addresses and, in some jurisdictions, IP addresses and other
        online identifiers.                                                       
        For example, in April 2016, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took full effect on
        25 May 2018. GDPR enhances data protection obligations for businesses and requires service providers (referred to as
        data processors) processing personal data on behalf of customers to cooperate with European data protection authorities,
        implement security measures and keep records of personal data processing activities. Noncompliance with the GDPR
        can trigger fines equal to or greater of EUR 20 million or 4% of global annual revenues. In addition, the GDPR imposes
        new data breach notification requirements, such as the duty to notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours
        of becoming aware of the breach if the data breach meets the requirements for notification. The GDPR also imposes
        additional obligations on undertakings to maintain records of processing activities with respect to personal data and to
        be able to respond to new data subject rights, including for example, the "right to be forgotten" (which requires
        companies to permanently delete a user’s personal data in certain circumstances) and data portability. Given the breadth
        and depth of changes in data protection obligations, preparing to meet the requirements of GDPR has required significant
        time and resources, including a review of the Group’s technology and systems currently in use against the requirements
        of GDPR. There are also additional EU laws and regulations (and member states’ implementations thereof) which govern
        the protection of consumers and of electronic communications. Also, in December 2015 the EU adopted the Directive on
        Payment Services in the Internal Market whose main objectives are: (i) to contribute to a more integrated and efficient
        European payments market; (ii) to further level the playing field for payment service providers by including new players;
        (iii) to make payments safer and more secure; and (iv) to enhance protection for European consumers and businesses.
        Furthermore, outside of the EU and the UK, the Group continues to see increased regulation of data privacy and security,
        including the adoption of more stringent subject matter specific laws. For example, in Switzerland, where data protection
        is regulated on the federal and the cantonal level, the Federal Act on Data Protection (DPA) and its corresponding
        ordinances regulate the processing of personal data by private parties and by federal authorities. In addition, there are
        cantonal rules addressing the processing of personal data by the cantonal and municipal authorities. The DPA is
        undergoing a complete revision, which is expected to be passed at some point later this year or in 2021. With its revision,
        the DPA is to comply with the revised Council of Europe Convention and its provisions are intended to be similar to those
        of the GDPR, although with a few conceptual differences, for example relating to legal grounds and sanctions. Apart from
        the DPA, other laws such as the Act against Unfair Competition, Telecommunications Act and the Swiss Penal Code
        contain further provisions governing data protection in Switzerland.      
        If the Group was to suffer or if one of the Group’s customers were to suffer a breach, the Group may be subject to the
        jurisdiction of a variety of European and EU member states’ agencies’ jurisdictions. The Group may have to comply with
        a variety of data breach laws, comply with any resulting investigations, as well as offer mitigation to customers and
        potential end users of certain customers to which the Group provides services. The Group could also be subject to fines,
        forfeitures and other penalties that may adversely impact the Group’s business. See Section 2.4.1 "Changes in laws and
        regulation may have an adverse effect on the Group’s profitability".

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        In addition, since 14 September 2019, compliance with the 2nd Payment Services Directive ("PSD2") became mandatory
        in the European Economic Area. PSD2 was established by the European Banking Authority to drive payment innovation
        and data security by reducing competitive barriers, mandating new security processes and encouraging standardized
        technology and imposes the use of 2 factor authentication, including a knowledge factor (something only the user knows
        (e.g. password, pin, ID number)), an ownership factor (something only the user possesses (e.g. mobile device, smart
        card) or and inherence factor (something only the user is (e.g. fingerprint, face or voice recognition)). To ensure smooth
        user experience, PSD2 requests payment providers to put in place security measures that are compatible with the level
        of risk involved in the payment service to make sure the right controls are put in place in relation to the transaction
        type. For low payment value, regular purchases strong authentication will not be required.
        As the Group continues to expand internationally, the Group has become subject to telecommunications laws and
        regulations in the foreign countries where the Group offers its products. The Group’s international operations are subject
        to country-specific governmental regulation and related actions that have increased and may continue to increase the
        Group’s costs or impact its products and Platform or prevent the Group from offering or providing the Group’s products
        in certain countries.                                                     
        In addition, in some countries where the Group operates, legislation has been enacted to restrict telemarketing and the
        use of automatic text messages without proper consent. The scope and interpretation of such laws that are or may be
        applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving and developing. For example, some foreign laws
        prohibit sending broad categories of messages unless the recipient has provided the sender advance consent to receipt
        of such messages, or in other words has "opted-in" to receiving such communication. If the Group does not comply with
        these laws, or regulations or if the Group becomes liable under these laws or regulations due to the failure of its
        customers to comply with these laws by obtaining proper consent, the Group could face direct liability.
        The terms of any injunctions, judgments, consent decrees or settlement agreements entered into in connection with
        enforcement actions or investigations against the Group in connection with any of the foregoing laws may also require
        the Group to change one or more aspects of the way the Group operates its business, which could impair the Group’s
        ability to attract and retain customers or could increase its operating costs.
        In addition, in order to procure, distribute and retain telephone numbers from the EU or certain other regions, the Group
        may be required to register with the local telecommunications regulatory authorities. The Group has registered and is in
        the process of registering in various countries in which the Group does business, but in some countries, the regulatory
        regime around provisioning of phone numbers is unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from
        jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Furthermore, these regulations and governments’ approach to their enforcement, as well as
        the Group’s products and services, are still evolving and the Group may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable
        regulations, or enforce compliance by the Group’s customers, on a timely basis or without significant cost. Also,
        compliance with these types of regulation may require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced
        revenue.

        8.1   Introduction                                                        
        LINK, one of Europe's leading providers of mobile messaging and CpaaS solutions in Europe, based on volume market
        share and local market presence1, is headquartered in Oslo, Norway. LINK assists enterprise, SME and government
        customers by providing mobile solutions for engagement with their end-customers and users. The Group was founded
        in 2001 and its original focus was SMS Application to Person (A2P) messaging services. As of 30 June 2020, the Group
        had approximately 461 employees and more than 33,000 customers across Europe, served from its headquarters in
        Oslo, as well as from its offices in Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, North
        Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
        In 2007, the Group acquired LINK Messaging AB, a voice services company founded in 1995. Over time, the Group has
        grown and evolved its business model into an omni-channel messaging and mobile technology platform leveraging CPaaS
        functionality to deliver efficient, automated solutions spanning across functions that are mission critical in customer’s
        operations, including customer service, customer engagement, marketing, notifications and payments, amongst several
        others.                                                                   
        Since its creation, the Group has expanded its business both organically and through acquisitions. For further information
        on the recent acquisitions made by the Group see Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions". These acquisitions increased LINK’s
        market position, financial strength and operational capability.           
        For the six months ended 30 June 2020, the Group generated revenue, Gross Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,
        Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Like-for-Like Revenue of NOK 1,717.6 million, 25%, NOK 160.0 million, NOK 182.6 million,
        11% and NOK 1,613.6 million, respectively. See Section 4.2.3 "Non-IFRS financial measures".
        For financial reporting purposes, the Group has divided its business into four reporting segments: (i) Nordics (includes
        Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Baltics); (ii) Central Europe (includes Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary,
        Poland, Romania and North Macedonia); (iii) Western Europe (includes Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy and France);
        (iv) Global Messaging (includes Switzerland, aggregator traffic and global enterprise customers). The table below sets
        out the Group's sales revenues and Gross Profit per reporting segment as of and for the six months ended 30 June 2020
        and 2019, and the years ended 31 December 2019, 2018 and 2017. The financial statements included as of and for the
        six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019, and as of and for the year ended 31 December 2019 represent the
        consolidated financial statements of the Group. As the Company acquired Link Mobility Group AS in 2018, full-year 2018
        and 2017 financial statements for the consolidated Group are not available. Accordingly, the financial statements
        included as of and for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017 represent the consolidated financial statements of
        the Group’s operating entity, Link Mobility Group AS. For information on presentation of financial information in the

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        8.3.1 Differentiated CPaaS platform focused on driving value by developing and delivering comprehensive solutions
              and optimal routing through all key OTT and operator channels       
        Over the Group’s 20-year history, LINK has developed a powerful CpaaS infrastructure, a cloud-based platform that
        enables LINK’s customers to add real-time communications features to their own applications without needing to build
        backend infrastructure and interfaces. The CPaaS platform has been designed to send large numbers of messages per
        second via a sophisticated portal that supports multiple messaging media (SMS, WhatsApp, RCS, etc.), enabling a
        multitude of solutions to be layered in. The platform has a scalable high-volume infrastructure and security, compliance
        and integration capabilities that can meet the needs of LINK’s customers and regulators.
        Based on its estimates of volume market share and local market presence, the Company believes it is a leading supplier
        in Europe of A2P messaging, a type of SMS messaging technique where a text is sent from a software application run
        by an enterprise to a consumer's device, and that it has leading positions in several key European markets, including
        (Norway, France, Sweden, Poland, Spain, Denmark, Bulgaria and Finland) in terms of volume of messages2.
        LINK’s CPaaS platform offers a complete development framework for building real-time communications features without
        the need for LINK’s customers to build their own. The LINK CPaaS platform includes software tools, standards-based
        application programming interfaces (APIs), sample code and pre-built applications. In addition, LINK also provides
        support and product documentation to help its customers throughout their development process, as well as offers
        software development kits (SDKs) and libraries for building applications on different desktop and mobile platforms.
        LINK’s CPaaS platform is solution-oriented, modular and decoupled, designed to support all customer types. It is founded
        on a powerful engine for security, reporting, common messaging gateway, billing, rating and mediation. LINK’s
        dedicated, advanced and scalable hybrid cloud-based infrastructure provides secure solutions for customers with high
        capacity and high-speed network connectivity optimized for the high volume of messages delivered.
        The Group’s platform offers an omni-channel CPaaS solution that caters both to the larger customers based on endless
        mobile communication capabilities powered by open APIs and to the smaller customers based on self-sign-up portals
        optimizing their customer journey. LINK product suite covers notifications, marketing and customer care use cases.
        LINK intends to build its growth based on (i) LINK’s carrier-grade, highly scalable and high-capacity messaging platform;
        (ii) developed relationships with customers that can be leveraged across markets and industries; (iii) its omni-channel
        layer featuring all existing mobile communication channels to date accessible via future-proof APIs; (iv) marketing
        innovation layer allowing customers to imagine customer engagement strategies through no or low coding solutions; (v)
        intelligent routing and orchestration powered by proprietary artificial intelligence; and (vi) deep mobile behaviour know-
        how and broad digitalisation experience.                                  
        The Group’s CPaaS platform has worldwide coverage and reach and is, as of the date of this Prospectus, connected to
        more than 1,000 mobile networks in more than 220 markets, thanks to more than 300 supplier connections worldwide
        and a cutting-edge connectivity with more than 135 direct operator connections.
        8.3.2 Strategic geographic footprint with 29 offices across Europe and established local leadership, delivering high-
              touch service                                                       
        The Group’s strategic geographic footprint includes 29 offices (24 offices with more than two employees and five offices
        with two employees) in 17 countries across Europe located in Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,
        Germany, Hungary, Italy, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United
        Kingdom. The Group has offices in close proximity to its customers in order to allow for short lead times, compliance
        with local requirements, as well as locally tailored contents and language.
        The Group has a geographically diversified portfolio of over 33,000 customer accounts across Europe, divided in four
        operating segments: (i) Nordics, (ii) Central Europe, (iii) Western Europe and (iv) Global Messaging. In terms of SMS
        A2P, the Group has a high market penetration in the Nordics segment, an average market penetration in the Global
        Messaging segment and a low or low- to mid-market penetration in Central and Western Europe. Gross Margin, for (i)
        Nordics, (ii) Central Europe, (iii) Western Europe and (iv) Global Messaging was 32%, 25%, 26% and 9%, respectively,
        for the six-months period ended 30 June 2020.                             
        Across the four operating segments, the Group focuses on three different go-to market approaches:
              a)    enterprise customers (customers with more than 50,000 messages on average per month). This
                    segment is characterized by higher volume, more complex functionality, focus on reliability, higher
                    touch with preferred pricing. LINK has a salesforce of 90 people focusing on this segment.
              b)    self-sign-up and small-medium enterprise customers (SSUs & SMEs) (customers with less than
                    50,000 messages on average per month). This segment is characterized by lower volume, less
                    functionality, focus on ease of use and lower touch with list pricing. The SSU market is inherently
                    local in its nature and local brands; cultural relevance and language delivery is essential to
                    addressing different countries. As such, the Group employs a multi-brand strategy in this segment,
                    across a number of countries. The Group also splits its service delivery to SSU customers between
                    SMS-driven messaging and more emerging OTT channels with CPaaS functionality.
              c)    partner customers (customers acquired through strategic partners selling the Group’s services to
                    their end customers, sometimes as part of an integrated offering). The Group has developed
                    relationships with enterprise customers across all four operating segments and key partners, such
                    as Oracle, Salesforce, Visma, Netlife and SopraSteria.

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        The Group has successfully leveraged its customer insights to develop and deploy products and services. The Group’s
        products and services benefit from innovations that provide its customers with premium integrated solutions for a wide
        spectrum of customers’ needs.                                             
        The Company believes these innovations, together with its long-lasting relationships, help the Group secure higher price
        points from its customers, given they support the Group’s premium service ("more-for-more" strategy), as well as
        promote greater customer loyalty.                                         
        8.3.3 Large and fast growing markets with substantial opportunity driven by digitalisation, messaging proliferation
              and OTT emergence                                                   
        LINK’s ability to serve OTT channels effectively and provide rich content is a key differentiator and the Company expects
        it will enable the Group to capture growth opportunities. LINK’s platform is ideally positioned to deliver the omni-channel
        messaging orchestration and complex solutions required to win the market. The Group’s CPaaS platform can be used for
        an ever-expanding universe of use cases: banking (confirmations, transaction alerts, two-factor-authentications, one-
        time PIN codes), healthcare (patient monitoring, voice authentication, appointment reminders), e-commerce
        (transaction alerts, two-factor-authentications, virtual phone numbers), industrial and utilities (meter readings, internet
        of things connectivity), transportation (process monitoring, shipping confirmation), media (news alerts, sponsored data,
        data from offline ads), ride hailing (authentication, arrival notifications, number masking), events (ticketing, fan
        engagement, fundraising), travel (journey and ticket status, mobile tickets, local numbers, loyalty programs) and retail
        (promotions, customer club sign-ups, marketing campaigns, mobile coupons).
        The Group’s customers are moving toward an omni-channel approach to maximise end-consumer engagement and the
        Group’s platform enables its customers to remain active across a plethora of messaging and media channels (e.g. social
        media, instant messaging, etc.) which serve different purposes and have varying penetration rates across geographies.
        In addition to SMS A2P and RCS (rich communication format, whereby rich content can be embedded into messages,
        create new use cases and new solutions), OTT is emerging as a major new channel of consumer engagement requiring
        omni-channel approaches. While SMS continues to account for the majority of messaging traffic and revenue thanks to
        its near universal reach, with more than 4bn frequent users and a 98% SMS read rate (90% read within three minutes),
        as well as high delivery reliability and better security, making SMS the preferred channel for many enterprises and
        governments for mission-critical messages (e.g. government COVID announcements), OTT channels are emerging as
        the end-consumers want to communicate with brands the way they communicate in their personal lives. While small
        today, OTT is growing rapidly and the Group believes it will drive overall A2P market growth in the future without
        replacing the SMS market, as these emerging channels ultimately serve different use cases compared to SMS.
        8.3.4 Strong focus on delivering mission-critical solutions to tier-1 enterprise customers and becoming deeply
              embedded                                                            
        The LINK strategy is to cater to the distinct needs of customers divided in: enterprise, partner and self-sign-up (SSU).
        The Company has a strong focus on enterprise customers.                   
        Enterprise customers, which are characterised by higher volume, more complex functionality demands, focus on
        reliability and higher profile with preferred pricing. In addition, enterprise customers typically require significant
        adjustments for end-user communication solutions. Enterprise customers have specific demands for product offerings,
        transaction volumes, price, quality, stability, reporting and account management.
        The Group utilises its sales team that communicates to existing and potential customers in 17 languages. The sales team
        comprises of 90 people that are divided into: (i) sales directors and managers; (ii) hunters (focused on attracting new
        customers); (iii) farmers (focused on maintaining the relationships with the existing customers; and (iv) partner sales
        team. Sales teams are represented across Group’s 29 offices (24 offices with more than two employees and five offices
        with two employees) and utilise their local presence coupled with global reach as well as market know-how, competitive
        differentiation and significant experience from digitalisation projects across many industries. The Company believes its
        enterprise sales force is a core differentiator in addressing the market and best practices developed over several years
        provide strong foundations for the Group’s future international expansion.
        The Company is focused on delivering critical mission solutions to its enterprise customers combining both connectivity
        and messaging solutions which are deeply embedded with the customer’s core business applications and systems. The
        Group is able to provide services to enterprise customers in a number of industries, namely the retail industry (including
        the e-commerce), the logistics industry, the banking and insurance industry and the software vendors and professional
        IT industry. For instance, the Group has developed vertically integrated solutions for its customers in the retail industry
        providing for customer club signups, marketing campaigns, mobile coupons and bonus codes and notification from e-
        commerce platforms. In the logistics industry, the Group offers parcel notification, delivery preference, mobile payments,
        tracing services and customer care dialogue all in one proprietary platform. In the banking and insurance industry, the
        Group provides two factor authentication, one time password (OTPs), and customer satisfaction surveys along with daily
        notifications. Finally, OTPs, marketing automation plugins, conversational commerce, notifications, multi-channel
        dialogue and mobile campaign builders are offered in one place to the Group’s customers in the Software Vendors &
        Professional IT industry.                                                 
        The Company believes its enterprise sales force is a core differentiator in addressing the market and best practices
        developed over several years provide strong foundations for the Group’s future international expansion.
        8.3.5 Recurring revenue with good predictability, retention and low Churn underpinning growth
        The Group currently serves over 33,000 customer accounts across Europe including, inter alia, Maersk, Postbank, the
        French government, Santander, DNB, Intersport, BNP Paribas and Desigual. The Group recorded a Revenue Net
                                        31                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        Retention Rate of 106% for the year ended 31 December 2019 and the Churn Rate of 3%3 for the year ended
        31 December 2019 and 4% for the six months ended 30 June 2020.            
                                                                                  
        The Group believes that the high Revenue Net Retention Rate and low Churn Rate show that LINK benefits from recurring
        and reasonably predictable revenue as well as excellent customer retention, all of which are key drivers of the Group’s
        growth and market leading position based on volume of market share4.      
        In addition, the Group benefits from a highly diversified customer base with no single customer representing more than
        5% of the Group’s revenue for the twelve months ended 30 June 2020 while the top ten customers account only for
        23.4% of the Group’s revenue for the twelve months ended 30 June 2020. The chart below shows a comprehensive
        customer concentration for the twelve months ended 30 June 2020.          
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
        The customer base is also diversified by geography with no single country representing more than 19% and no single
        industry representing more than 24% of revenue for the six months period ended June 2020 as shown by the graphics
        below. The charts below show a customer split by geography and by industry.

        The Group's recurring revenue with good predictability, retention and low Churn Rates are the foundation the Group has
                                                                                  
        exploited not only to acquire new customers (Sopra Steria, BNP Paribas, Lilly, Aleris, Thales, Lowell, etc.) but also to
        increase revenue from existing customers.                                 
        One of the Group’s strengths is the ability of cross engaging, cross selling and up selling at the same time by (i) providing
        additional products and services, (ii) finding new ways to successfully exploit the existing products and services as well
        as (iii) offering upgrades, add-ons as well as dedicated short codes, dashboards and insights as proved by Like-for-Like
        Revenue growth rate of 11% and 9% for years ended 31 December 2018 and 2019, respectively.
        The Company believes that these long-lasting relationships are a competitive barrier to entry that drive an advantage
        on the Company’s platform and services.                                   
        8.3.6 Proven M&A platform, core to LINK’s strategy in establishing local leadership, providing substantial
              incremental growth opportunities                                    
        In addition to its organic growth, the Group has successfully completed 16 M&A transactions since 2017, including the
        acquisitions of Linus, WhateverMobile, GlobalMouth, Labyrintti, Responsfabrikken, NetMessage, SimpleSMS, GMS, Total
        Connect, Voicecom, ViaNett, SMSAPI, DIDIMO, Horisen, Netsize, Multiwizz, HSL, SMSit, SeeMe, Spot-Hit and TeraComm
        Group and focused on extracting synergies from day one, both in terms of revenue and costs. See Section 11.3.2
        "Acquisitions".                                                           
        The Group’s strategic approach has been to acquire footprint in the local markets with strong customer base and strong
        local management in order to establish local leadership, leverage the Group’s scale and share best practices and know-
        how across the Group’s pan-European footprint in order to further reduce costs and improve margins.
        8.3.7 Proven and deep management team with well-defined strategy to deliver long-term profitable growth
        The Group’s management team has significant industry experience and the expertise to lead the Group’s future growth
        strategy as it has demonstrated strong leadership and its ability to execute corporate strategies. The executive board is
        supported by experienced business unit management teams, which, in turn, are further supported by strong local teams.
        The Chief Executive Officer, Guillaume Van Gaver, Chief Financial Officer, Thomas Berge, and Chief Technology Officer,
        Torbjørn G. Krøvel, were appointed in September 2019, September 2016 and January 2019, respectively, and have been
        instrumental to the growth of the business.                               
        The Company believes that the industry knowledge and leadership skills of its management team, combined with its
        long-term management experience, provides it with a significant competitive advantage and also positions it favourably
        for profitable future growth. Following the consummation of the Take-over, the Company drew from the market
        expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of Victory who could support its business and management
        thanks to strong expertise and a strong track record of driving cost savings and improvements, while at the same time
        growing its portfolio companies both organically and through targeted acquisitions.
        8.4   Strategy and objectives                                             
        In order to achieve the Group’s long-term goal of profitable growth and to maintain its innovation and technology
        leadership position, the Group pursues a strategy which is focused on six main pillars (i) go-to-market: growth from
        existing customers, (ii) go-to-market: growth from new customers through go-to-market expansion, (iii) product and
        technology: further strengthen CPaaS platform, (iv) product and technology: benefit from continued innovation ("App
        Store"), (v) digitalisation multiplier effect and (vi) M&A.               
        In addition, as part of its strategy, the Group will focus on continuing what has made it successful while also leveraging
        the momentum through implementing its business model and performance culture in acquired companies, continuing to
        enhance its talent pool and continuing to expand and increase market share.
        8.4.1 Go-to-market: growth from existing customers                        
        The Group believes there is substantial long-term growth potential embedded in its strong existing customer relationships
        that it intends to continue to capitalise on by (i) capturing growing messaging volumes as customers spend more budget
                                        33                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        dollars on communication technologies to improve end-user engagement, (ii) expanding and increasing wallet share by
        increasing usage of LINK solutions in customer footprints, (iii) upselling new solutions and (iv) optimizing pricing.
                                                                                  
        As digitalisation continues to proliferate, end customers expect to be able to communicate with brands through their
        preferred messaging and communications channels and engage in two-way conversations which will substantially
        increase messaging volumes required for customer satisfaction. Addressing customer expectations poses a significant
        challenge for brands to unify their messages and expand their reach through traditional (A2P) and newer (OTT)
        distribution channels. LINK enables improvement of the customer relationship by enabling customised messaging
        solutions for optimal reach of the end-user through their preferred channel.
        Additionally, LINK expects significant growth from existing customers through its land-and-expand strategy. Utilizing
        this strategy, LINK creates what it believes are unique and high-value omni-channel communication solutions at a
        regional level and expands these solutions globally as value is proven. Further, the company leverages its comprehensive
        suite of solutions and rapid development capabilities to build new solutions for existing customers’ expanding needs.
        Given LINK’s global customer base and history of acquisitions, price optimisation is a key component of the Group’s
        ability to effectively monetise existing customers. LINK employs a standard pricing strategy across all regions using a
        data-driven approach. This strategy allows the Group to harmonise prices for customers with presence in multiple
        countries and also gives LINK the ability to effectively optimise pricing for add-on capabilities, according to local markets.
        The LINK pricing strategy, when implemented, has allowed LINK to improve unit economics over time, including the
        ability to boost margins and grow revenue. The Group has recognised demonstrated success in Norway and is now rolling
        out this strategy to additional geographies.                              
        8.4.2 Go-to-market: new customers through go-to-market expansion          
        The LINK strategy is to cater to the distinct needs of customers through a differentiated and localised go-to-market
        strategy. LINK is present in each of its footprint geographies which drives a significant advantage as go-to-market must
        be led at the local level to best engage customers, given the nuances of a geographically diverse business. Best practice
        strategies exist in the Company today and LINK is focused on rolling them out across the footprint. LINK divides its
        customers into three segments: enterprise, self-sign-up and partner.      
        Enterprise                                                                
        Enterprise sales have been a traditional focus area for LINK and is a well-developed segment across Nordics, Central
        Europe and Western Europe. The Group’s Enterprise strategy focuses on investing in critical localised salesforces to
        maintain regional expertise and win new customers in both new and existing territories. The Group’s global sales team
        works together with boots-on-the-ground local sales representatives to execute the local agreements. By utilizing a local
        salesforce, LINK is able to better build strong direct relationships and deeply integrate with customer systems, increasing
        the stickiness of solutions.                                              
        Self-Sign-Up                                                              
        Self-Sign-Up, or "SSU", approach targets lower volume, lower touch customers, with a focus on ease of use and ability
        to quickly send messages. With sales done predominantly online, the strategy has minimal onboarding costs. Online
        marketing & local customer support can be set up quickly to bootstrap markets, before an enterprise strategy is
        employed. LINK leverages its existing SSU brands and successful management "playbooks" to expand into other
        geographies rapidly, without utilizing sales representatives and heavy sales and marketing investments. SSU is well-
        developed in central Europe but has opportunity to grow in the Nordics and Western Europe.
        Partners                                                                  
        Partnership strategy entails working with large and established global enterprises, allowing them to integrate LINK
        solutions as part of their own or resell LINK solutions to their existing customers. LINK currently maintains a number of
        large Partners, including (i) independent software vendors, such as Hansen Technologies, Netlife and Sopra Steria, which
        offer the Group’s services as a part of their offering, (ii) enterprise software integrators, such as Oracle, Salesforce and
        Visma, which are able to sell the Group’s services to their customer base as an integrated part of their solutions, (iii)
        telecommunication companies, such as Telefonica, Telia Company and Telenor, for which the Group’s CPaaS Platform is
        a natural extension which enriches their own propositions and product offerings to their customers, (iv) customer care
        providers, for which the Group’s CPaaS Platform provides a backbone to their products while also enriching the LINK’s
        offerings by adding chatbot and customer care specialists and (v) OTT partners, such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger,
        Apple Business Chat and Viber, which need the Group as a strategic partner to access Enterprise customers.
        LINK is focused on expanding the number of valuable Partners within each of these segments to further broaden the
        LINK ecosystem. These partnerships give LINK the ability to scale quickly, as they bring immediate credibility and access
        to customers in new markets. This gives LINK substantial opportunity to fill gaps across its current footprint, especially
        in Central and Western Europe where this segment is less developed.       
        8.4.3 Product and technology: further strengthen CPaaS platform           
        Maintaining a competitive advantage through advanced technology is central to LINK’s strategy. One of the Group’s
        most significant competitive advantage is its ability to offer, through its LINK CPaaS Platform, a complete development
        framework for building real-time communications solutions without the need for the Group’s customers to build their
        own, featuring: (i) a successful global delivery rate in excess of 90% (LINK’s operational capabilities are able to provide
        the delivery rates in excess of 99%, but the recipient may not receive the SMS due to errors by end-customer’s input of
        phone number and the irregularity of updates of personal details), (ii) failover routing to secure quality proposition, (iii)
        route quality and fast delivery as well as load balancing and queue sizing and (iv) a 24/7 network operating centres and
        proprietary monitoring.                                                   
                                        34                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        LINK aims to continue delivering for customers by further building out the platform by (i) expanding formats, (ii)
        increasing omni-channel engagement channels and, (iii) building out next-generation CPaaS capabilities. As the way the
        world communicates evolves, the LINK platform evolves in parallel. LINK's goal to expand communication formats allows
        LINK to maintain a strong lead over the competition by being the go-to platform for email, conversations, messaging,
        voice and app notifications. Further, given customers often communicate with their own customers through multiple
        channels, LINK views omni-channel engagement as a core capability. LINK's CPaaS platform gives its customers the
        ability to increase reach through additional channels, including OTT, RCS and SMS, to facilitate enriched communication
        and additional use cases, increasing overall customer engagement and allowing customers the ability communicate in
        whichever way they prefer.                                                
        As LINK builds out its platform, it aims to not only evolve with the industry, but be an industry leader bringing to market
        next-gen solutions that make the platform more effective and efficient. These solutions include intelligent ML-driven
        orchestration to facilitate advanced use cases such as Person-to-Application, Customer Care and Intelligent
        Conversations.                                                            
        8.4.4 Product and technology: benefit from continued innovation           
        In order to meet and exceed customer needs, LINK works in close cooperation with customers to build new and innovative
        solutions, to ensure that LINK is providing solutions that are adding value to its customers. In addition to the next
        generation CPaaS platform, the Group expects to see sustained, long-term growth driven by investment in its "App
        Store". The Company is on track to launch this decentralised marketing and innovation platform, which will enable users
        to easily discover add-ons and standalone products that can be integrated into the existing product and services suite
        offered. Examples of innovative Apps include Coupons, LINK Identity, Mobile Invoice and more.
        In addition to hosting LINK's own value-add applications, the App Store is also expected to offer third-party add-ons to
        further enhance the portfolio of solutions available to LINK customers. This third-party enablement is expected to greatly
        expand LINK's capabilities, allowing outside developers to create unique and localised solutions. Further, this helps LINK
        accelerate the time-to-market, in a cost-efficient way, of additional solutions as more developers are working on the
        platform. Finally, this third-party ecosystem increases revenue by both (i) increasing messaging volumes through new
        use cases and, (ii) creating a new revenue stream as additional license revenue is earned from hosting third-party
        applications on the App Store.                                            
        8.4.5 Digitalisation multiplier effect                                    
        LINK expects digitalisation of the B2C mobile messaging market to bolster the growth from its go-to-market and product
        & technology development efforts, primarily through (i) volume expansion in existing markets and (ii) adoption of
        solutions in other verticals. As the Group makes efforts to grow as an individual leader in the market, this digitalisation
        will further support growth efforts.                                      
        As Nordic countries lead the way in B2C messaging penetration in Europe, and additional European markets mature in
        their uses of CPaaS, the Group expects to gain substantial revenue potential from volume growth across other existing
        markets. The success LINK has seen in Norway, which is historically an early adopter of technology, is an indicator of
        future potential success in other markets. Nordic and European markets are slower in adopting technological innovation
        than the Norwegian market. The Group expects to see performance similar to its success in Norway in these markets
        moving forward.                                                           
        In addition to volume expansion in existing geographies, there is a significant opportunity for penetration of LINK
        solutions in other slow-adopting verticals such as logistics and manufacturing, as enterprise customers accelerate their
        digital transformation to increase customer engagement. This accelerated push has only been further fuelled by COVID-
        19, due to the high demand for enhanced remote communications.            
        8.4.6 M&A Strategy: the three-pillar foundation                           
        M&A remains a key component of the Group’s growth strategy. As it has in the past with its acquisitions of Linus,
        WhaterverMobile, GlobalMouth, Labyrintti, Responsfabrikken, NetMessage, SimpleSMS, GMS, Total Connect, Voicecom,
        ViaNett, SMSAPI, DIDIMO, Horisen, Netsize, Multiwizz, HSL, SMSit, SeeMe, Spot-Hit and TeraComm Group, the Group
        continuously explores the market with the intention to evaluate and acquire additional companies that add significant
        value from a technology and product perspective and are also financially accretive. Once an acquisition target is
        identified, subject to market conditions and the complexity of the transaction, the Group is capable of closing the M&A
        transaction in less than 60 days. The Group has currently identified targets for potential future acquisitions.
        The Group intends to execute acquisitions in the least dilutive and most cost-effective manner, using cash from its
        balance sheet or other sources, equity or a combination of both through a three-pillar approach: (i) add-ons, i.e. tuck-
        in acquisitions to further strengthen local presence and position as a market leader; (ii) level-up, i.e. acquiring platform
        companies to penetrate and build market positions in new territories and (iii) solutions, i.e. seeking new and innovative
        solutions to leverage the existing footprint and further differentiate the Group’s product offering. The Group is actively
        exploring near term acquisition opportunities, expected to be funded through a combination of cash from its balance
        sheet and/or drawings from the Senior Facilities Agreement and/or equity. Any equity issued in connection with such
        acquisitions during the first 180 days after the first date of trading and official listing of the Offer Shares will be issued
        under a carve-out or waiver from the Company’s lock-up undertakings. See Section 17.18 “Lock up”.
        LINK has an impressive M&A history, having entered new markets and strengthened market position through 24
        acquisitions across 16 countries since 2014. These acquisitions have been sourced almost entirely organically, with a
        limited number introduced through structured processes. Through these acquisitions, LINK have acquired numerous
        technological capabilities that have enriched the platform and accelerated time to market of products and solutions.
        These include marketing automation, voice, RCS, chatbots, advanced APIs and self-sign-up capabilities and
        functionalities.

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        LINK's experienced internal mergers and acquisitions team has a proven track record of closing deals. The team manages
        the process in-house, which includes detailed integration planning which is key in extracting synergies and implementing
        best practices across its footprint.                                      
        The Company has a well-established M&A organisation and is well positioned to execute on its strategy of expanding
        internationally and strengthening CPaaS capabilities through M&A. The Group's M&A team has cultivated relationships
        with companies across the CPaaS ecosystem globally and has a strong track record of evaluating and executing on M&A
        opportunities. Going forward, the Group expects certain of these M&A opportunities to be outside of Europe, with over
        EUR 300 million and EUR 1.2 billion of revenue opportunity identified in the near-term and medium-term, respectively.
        These opportunities span multiple geographies including North America, Latin America, APAC, and Africa, in addition to
        Europe, and also include opportunities that would further strengthen the Group's CPaaS platform and solutions.
        In addition to its M&A knowledge from past transactions, due to market dynamics, LINK has a strong negotiation position
        given the large pool of potential targets and a limited number of scaled buyers that can execute.

                         connections; and (iv) 5 countries in Europe with operator status;
              v)    Public operations and security focus to support high demand customers as well as local presence
        LINK's customers use the Group's solutions either through technical integration or through web interfaces operated by
        the Group. Technical integration entails that LINK's API's or web-services are integrated with the customer’s technical
        systems and is operated with technical interfaces. LINK's customers may use LINK's solutions by opening a URL in an
        internet browser. The majority of LINK’s customers pay a fixed monthly fee for a licence to access LINK solutions;
        however, the amount varies based on the number of modules used by the customer.
        All infrastructure connected to LINK's mobile messaging is managed in-house, including both development and
        operations. However, the Group’s operations are integrated with technical services from third-party suppliers in
        connection with mobile interaction with end-users, which includes delivery of outgoing messages (mobile terminated
        messages) and receiving incoming messages (mobile originated messages). Examples of such third-party suppliers are
        telecommunications operators for SMS communication, Facebook for communication through Facebook Messenger and
        Apple for App-push notices. The Group uses standardised developer tools and standardised technical setups, both on-
        premises and in the cloud, and it is not locked into a specific infrastructure or technology use in this respect.
        In 2019, LINK has developed a common technological platform at the Group level and is in process of closing down a
        certain number of local platforms as customers, services and traffic are transferred to the common Group platform. LINK
        has kept some local platforms due to security reasons and strategic priorities.

        4% for the six months ended 30 June 2020. The Group has also recorded 121% of Net Customer Expansion Rate in six
        months ended 30 June 2020, i.e., a raise in the revenue generated from customers at the end of the period compared
        to the corresponding revenue from the same period in 2019.                
        LINK signed 1,465 new contracts during the six months ended 30 June 2020, of which 700 with new customers and 765
        new contracts with existing customers. In particular, LINK signed contracts, inter alia, with BNP Paribas, Thales, Lowell,
        S2S and Aleris.

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        The Group uses a template form of customer agreement for all sales on its main platform. However, each LINK subsidiary
        has the option to use separate form agreements with their customers when providing their platforms and solutions to
        the market. The Group maintains an internal check list, where the basic requirements for any customer agreements are
        stated (including, for example, liability caps, IP protection, price and payment terms, and scope of services). All form
        agreements must adhere to the check list. Certain of the Group form agreements include incentives and sanctions
        provisions in the event of disrupt of services, which may amount to a maximum of 100% of the fixed monthly fees. The
        Group routinely revises and improves form agreements, to adapt such forms to the new solutions and platforms it
        provides. For some customers, typically for larger enterprises and public customers, LINK may be required to negotiate
        agreements based on customer’s template. The Group’s top 10 customers accounted for 22.7% of the Group’s revenues
        for the six months ended 30 June 2020. The Group attempts to mitigate the impact of any consolidation by expanding
        its range of products and services and effective negotiations or providing services to individual businesses within
        particular companies. Customer consolidation could increase the Group’s concentration risk by increasing the Group’s
        dependence on a limited number of customers as well as reduce aggregate demand for LINK’s products and services in
        the future. However, the Group is currently not dependent on any single customer contract.
        Customer contracts are based on a subscription fee element and usage invoicing. However, in some cases the Group
        will enter into agreements where the customer pay for services related to specific adjustments or development of new
        functionality to the customer's project or products offered by LINK.

        and the management is focused on rolling them out across the footprint. Additionally, LINK is present in each of its
        footprint countries, driving a significant advantage.

        The Group has agreements with third-party suppliers in connection with mobile messaging. The most significant
        agreements in such respect are those with telecom operators that provide the Group the access to the mobile messaging
        infrastructure.                                                           
        In addition to third-party supplier agreements, customer contracts are continuously entered into in the ordinary course
        of business. In particular, the Group uses a template form of agreement for all sales on its main platform. However,
        each LINK subsidiary has the option to use separate form agreements with their customers when providing their
        platforms and solutions to the market. The Group maintains an internal check list, where the basic requirements for any
        customer agreements are stated (including, for example, liability caps, IP protection, price and payment terms, and
        scope of services). All form agreements must adhere to the check list. Certain of the Group's form agreements include
        incentives and sanctions provisions in the event of disruption of services, which may amount to a maximum of 100% of
        the fixed monthly fees. The Group routinely revises and improves form agreements, to adapt such forms to the new
        solutions and platforms it provides. For some customers, typically for larger enterprises and public customers, LINK may
        be required to negotiate agreements based on customer’s template. However, as no single customer is material to LINK's
        business or profitability, the Group is not dependent on any single customer contract.
        Apart from the Senior Facility Agreement, the Group has not entered into any material contracts outside the ordinary
        course of business for the three years prior to the date of the Prospectus or any other contract entered into outside the
        ordinary course of business that contains any provision under which any member of the Group has any obligation or
        entitlement.

        8.11  Intellectual property and research and development

        "Intercreditor Agreement"). The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law.
        Under the Senior Facilities Agreement, LINK Pecunia was the original borrower and the original guarantor of the facilities
        made available thereunder. Following the first utilisation of the Senior Facilities Agreement, LINK Mobility Group AS also
        acceded as an additional borrower and a guarantor. LINK Pecunia and LINK Mobility Group AS are referred in this
        summary together as the "Borrowers".                                      
        9.4.2 Amount and ranking of the facilities                                
        The Senior Facilities Agreement provides for three committed facilities, comprising: (1) a "Facility B" term loan
        acquisition facility split into a Norwegian kroner denominated tranche (in principal amount of NOK 755 million) and a
        euro denominated tranche (in principal amount of EUR 119 million) (both tranches together, "Facility B"), (2) a revolving
        credit facility in principal amount of EUR 25 million (the "RCF") and (3) a capital expenditure and committed acquisition
        term loan facility in principal amount of EUR 85 million (the "Capex Facility", and together with Facility B and the RCF,
        the "Facilities").                                                        
        Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities owed by the Borrowers and certain other subsidiaries of Victory
        and outstanding under the Facilities rank in right and priority of payment pari passu and without any preference between
        them, and the Transaction Security ranks and secures such liabilities under the Facilities pari passu and without any
        preference between them.                                                  
        However, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities outstanding in respect of the RCF shall have "super-
        senior" ranking in relation to the application of proceeds from the realisation or enforcement of all or any part of the
        Transaction Security (the "Recoveries"). Any such Recoveries shall be applied for application towards the discharge of
        liabilities outstanding under the RCF (and certain priority hedging liabilities) ahead of being applied towards the discharge
        of liabilities outstanding under Facility B or the Capex Facility.        
                                        45                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        9.4.3 Purpose and availability of the committed facilities                
        Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, all of the proceeds of Facility B were used by LINK Pecunia on
        4 October 2018 (the "Closing Date") to pay the consideration payable for the Acquisition of all of the issued share
        capital of LINK Mobility Group AS in October 2018, the payment of associated financing fees, transaction costs and
        expenses incurred by Victory in connection with the Acquisition, and the repayment of certain then existing indebtedness
        of LINK Mobility Group AS and its subsidiaries.                           
        In relation to the RCF, the Borrowers may use the amounts borrowed under the RCF from time to time towards, amongst
        other things, financing or refinancing the general corporate purposes or working capital requirements of the Group. The
        RCF may be utilised by the Borrowers by way of cash drawings, by way of the issuance of letters of credit, and also by
        way of the provision of bilateral ancillary facilities such as, amongst other things, facilities providing for overdrafts,
        guarantees, and short term loan facilities. The RCF is available for drawing by the Borrowers for the period commencing
        on the Closing Date to the date falling one month prior to the termination date of the RCF described below. As is typical
        for revolving credit facility, amounts repaid under the RCF may be redrawn unless such amount has been permanently
        cancelled by the Borrowers.                                               
        In relation to the Capex Facility, the Borrowers may use the proceeds of the Capex Facility for, amongst other things,
        directly or indirectly financing or refinancing the capital expenditure requirements of the Group, and directly or indirectly
        financing or refinancing the consideration and other amounts payable for or in connection with the acquisition of entities
        and businesses that are permitted to be made under the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement. The Capex Facility is
        only available for drawing for the period commencing on the Closing Date to the date falling 36 months from the Closing
        Date.                                                                     
        9.4.4 Uncommitted Additional term and revolving facilities                
        The Senior Facilities Agreement also contain uncommitted "additional facility" provisions (the "Additional Facilities"),
        which subject to certain conditions permit LINK Pecunia to establish additional facilities to be documented within the
        Senior Facilities Agreement, up to capped amount (being the aggregate of a numeric based amount and a leverage
        based amount) prescribed by the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement (the "Permitted Indebtedness Cap").
        An Additional Facility may be provided as a term facility or a revolving facility. However, where an Additional Facility is
        to be provided as a revolving facility, in addition to complying with the Permitted Indebtedness Cap, the aggregate total
        amount of such additional revolving facility must also not exceed the greater of (i) EUR 25 million and (ii) the lower of
        75% of the last twelve months earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of the Group calculated in
        accordance with the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement and EUR 40 million.
        An Additional Facility provided as a revolving facility shall also have the right to rank on a "super-senior" basis to Facility
        B and the Capex Facility and pari passu with the RCF on the terms described above, subject to the terms of the
        Intercreditor Agreement.                                                  
        The aggregate principal amount of all Additional Facilities (other than any Additional Facilities provided as a revolving
        facility) must not exceed EUR 400 million (the "Additional Facility Cap") unless the relevant amount in excess of such
        Additional Facility Cap is first offered by LINK Pecunia to be provided by the original lenders party to the Senior Facilities
        Agreement, or where such original lenders have rejected or otherwise confirmed that they are unwilling or unable to
        commit to provide such excess amount above the Additional Facility Cap.   
        Other than the consent of the lender or lenders providing any Additional Facility, no consent of the existing lenders under
        the Senior Facilities Agreement is required to establish such Additional Facility. The existing lenders under the Senior
        Facilities Agreement are not committed to provide any such Additional Facilities. However, any Additional Facility (other
        than an Additional Facility provided as a revolving facility) must first be offered to each original lender party to the Senior
        Facilities Agreement, prior to Victory approaching any other potential debt providers for such term Additional Facility.
        Any Additional Facility proposed to be provided as a revolving facility must first be offered to the original RCF lender
        prior to LINK Pecunia approaching any other potential debt providers for such revolving Additional Facility.
        9.4.5 Interest and commitment fees                                        
        Loans made under the Senior Facilities Agreement will bear interest at EURIBOR for loans made in euro and NIBOR for
        loans made in Norwegian kroner, plus a fixed margin based on the facility that is drawn, namely:
              a)    in relation to any euro denominated Facility B or Capex Facility loan, a margin of 6.50%. per annum;
              b)    in relation to any Norwegian kroner denominated Facility B loan or Capex Facility loan, a margin of
                    6.75% per annum; and                                          
              c)    in relation to any RCF loan, a margin of 3.50% per annum.     
        For any Additional Facility, the margin shall be that percentage rate specified by LINK Pecunia in the relevant notice
        establishing the Additional Facility in the form required by, and pursuant to the terms of, the Senior Facilities Agreement.
        LINK Pecunia is required to pay a commitment fee on the available commitments under the RCF at an annual rate equal
        to 35% of the applicable Margin and a commitment fee on the available commitments under the Capex Facility at a
        current rate of 2.00% per annum on the available commitments under the Capex Facility. This commitment fee is payable
        quarterly in arrears, and on any cancelled commitments at the time of such cancellation. In addition to the above
        described commitment fees, LINK Pecunia is required to pay certain other financing fees, including yearly agency and
        security agent fees, fees in respect of any ancillary facilities and fees that may be payable in respect of any issued letters
        of credit.

        from time to time is equal to or exceeds 80% of the consolidated pro forma earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
        and amortisation and consolidated revenue of the Group.                   
        In addition to the above described guarantees, LINK Pecunia and certain of its subsidiaries have also granted the
        Transaction Security over certain of their assets (including shares and material banks accounts) to secure the Facilities
        for the benefit of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement.     
        Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless it is
        instructed otherwise by the "Instructing Group", and such Instructing Group may give or refrain from giving instructions
        to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security as they see fit.
        Under the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, the "Instructing Group" at any time comprises the

        the "super-senior" creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement shall comprise the "Instructing Group".
        The Company is a party to, and subject to certain undertakings contained in, the Senior Facilities Agreement. The
        Company has also granted security over certain of its assets including the shares it holds in LINK Pecunia in favour of
        the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, but is not a guarantor under the Senior Facilities Agreement.
        9.4.7 Financial covenant

        potential breaches of the financial covenant.

        other business opportunities".                                            
        The Senior Facilities Agreement also contains a holding company covenant which restrict the Company from trading,
        carrying on any business, owning assets or incurring any liabilities or granting security unless such activity is a “Permitted
        Holding Company Activity”. A Permitted Holding Company Activity includes, amongst other things, the provision of
        administrative, managerial, legal, treasury and accounting services and the secondment of employees to other members
        of the Group of a type customarily provided by a holding company to its subsidiaries and normal holding company
        activities.

        9.4.9 Change of control                                                   
        The Senior Facilities Agreement also contains a change of control provision which allows the lenders to require the
        mandatory prepayment of the Facilities in full by the Borrowers if (at any time prior to a listing) the "Initial Investors"
        (being ABRY Partners II, LLC and its affiliates) cease (directly or indirectly) to have the power (whether by way of
        ownership of shares, proxy, contract, agency or otherwise) to appoint directors or other equivalent officers of LINK
        Pecunia which control the majority of the votes which may be cast at a meeting of the board of directors of LINK Pecunia,
        or cease (directly or indirectly) to control more than 50% of the issued voting share capital of LINK Pecunia.
        Upon and following a listing, a change of control will occur if the Initial Investors cease (directly or indirectly) to control
        more than 30% of the issued voting share capital of LINK Pecunia, or any person or group of persons acting in concert
        (other than with the Initial Investors and any person directly or indirectly controlled by any of them) acquires (directly
        or indirectly) beneficially more of the issued voting share capital of LINK Pecunia than is held (directly or indirectly) in
        aggregate by the Initial Investors.                                       
        9.4.10 Maturity                                                           
        The Senior Facilities Agreement provides that Facility B shall mature on 4 October 2025, that the RCF shall mature on
        4 October 2024, and that the Capex Facility shall mature on 4 October 2025. The Borrowers are required to repay Facility
        B and the Capex Facility in full on their final maturity date. The RCF must be repaid (and may be redrawn) on the last
        day of its interest period.                                               
        9.4.11 Prepayments and call protection                                    
        The Borrowers will be required to mandatorily repay outstanding amounts under the Senior Facilities Agreement upon
        the occurrence of certain events, including, without limitation, certain change of control events (as described above)
        and illegality of any lender (in the case of the latter, with a repayment only of the affected lender’s participation).
        In addition, upon the occurrence of a "Listing" (not resulting in a change of control as described above), LINK Pecunia
        is required to promptly notify the facility agent upon becoming aware of such Listing and ensure that, subject to a gross
        leverage ratio test, a certain amount of the proceeds of such Listing are applied in mandatory prepayment of the
        Facilities, which prepayment, to the extent made after 4 October 2020, shall be at par in accordance with the terms of
        the Senior Facilities Agreement. For the purposes of the Senior Facilities Agreement, a "Listing" means the listing or the
        admission to trading of all or any part of the share capital of LINK Pecunia or any holding company of LINK Pecunia on
        any recognised investment exchange. The amount of the proceeds of the Listing required to be applied in prepayment
        are as follows:                                                           
              a)    if, on a pro forma basis, the ratio of "consolidated total gross debt" to "consolidated pro forma
                    EBITDA" (as each such term is defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the "Gross Leverage
                    Ratio") on the applicable test date immediately prior to the Listing (calculated in accordance with
                    the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement) is greater than 5.50:1, 100 per cent. of such proceeds
                    shall be applied in prepayment of the Facilities the extent required to reduce the pro forma Gross
                    Leverage Ratio to 5.50:1;                                     
              b)    to the extent that, on a pro forma basis, the Gross Leverage Ratio on the applicable test date
                    immediately prior to the Listing for the relevant period ending on such date (calculated in
                    accordance with the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement) is (or becomes, taking into account
                    the application of any prepayment required under paragraph (A) above) greater than 4.50:1, but
                    less than or equal to 5.50:1, 50 per cent. of the remaining of such proceeds shall be applied in
                    prepayment of the Facilities in accordance with the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement to the
                    extent required to reduce the pro forma Gross Leverage Ratio to 4.50:1;
              c)    thereafter if, on a pro forma basis, the Gross Leverage Ratio on the applicable test date immediately
                    prior to the Listing (calculated in accordance with the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement) is
                    (or becomes, taking into account the application of any prepayment required and deducting such
                    amounts as the LINK Pecunia is entitled to retain, in each case, under paragraphs (A) and/or (B)
                    above) less than or equal to 4.50:1, no prepayment of any such remaining proceeds shall be
                    required to be made and such remaining proceeds may be retained by the Group for any purpose
                    not prohibited by the Senior Facilities Agreement and other related finance documents.
        The Borrowers may make voluntary repayments under the Senior Facilities Agreement. A prepayment fee equal to 1.00%
        of the principal amount of the Facility B loans or Capex Facility loans (as the case may be) being prepaid is payable up
        to the date falling 24 months after the Closing Date. Following the date falling 24 Months after the Closing Date, the
        Borrowers may make any prepayment of the Facility B loans or Capex Facility loans at par.
        The Company expects to use approximately NOK 1.4 billion of the proceeds from the Offering to partly repay outstanding
        debt under the Senior Facilities Agreement. See Section 5 "Reasons for the Offering and the Listing".
        9.4.12 Events of default                                                  
        The Senior Facilities Agreement includes various events of default as are customary for leveraged acquisition financing
        agreements of this nature and type, including (amongst other things) for non-payment of principal and interest,
        insolvency and the commencement of insolvency proceedings.

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
        10    SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION                            
        The following selected annual financial information for the financial years ended 31 December 2019, 2018 and 2017 has
        been extracted from the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless otherwise indicated, the interim financial
        information for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 has been derived from the Condensed Interim Financial
        Statements (together the "Financial Statements").                         
        The financial information included as of and for the three and six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 and as of and
        for the year ended 31 December 2019 represent the consolidated financial statements of the Group. As the Company
        acquired Link Mobility Group AS in 2018, full-year 2018 and 2017 financial statements for the consolidated Group are
        not available. Accordingly, the financial statements included as of and for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017
        represent the consolidated financial statements of the Group’s operating entity, Link Mobility Group AS. See Section
        4.2.1 "Financial information in the Prospectus" for a description of the Financial Statements and Section 8.1
        "Introduction" for a description of the Take-over.                        
        As set out in Section 4.2.1 "Financial information in the Prospectus", the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements have
        been prepared for the purpose of the Offering and this Prospectus. A reader should note that as a consequence of the
        difference in reporting entity, the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2018 Consolidated Financial
        Statements are not fully comparable.                                      
        In July 2018, the Take-over was launched. Following completion of the Take-over, the Company controlled 100% of the
        shares in LINK Mobility Group AS through LINK Pecunia (formerly known as Victory Partners VIII Norway AS) and became
        the new parent company of the Group.                                      
        The Company was incorporated in May 2018 in connection with the Take-over. The Company has prepared annual
        financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2019. As the Take-over was completed in October
        2018, the Company's annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2018 only cover the operations of the Group
        from 9 October 2018 to and as of 31 December 2018. To provide comparable figures for the Group's operation, the
        Prospectus will present the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements
        prepared by Link Mobility Group AS.                                       
        The 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements included herein do not
        reflect the Group’s financing arrangements because the borrowings under such agreements were drawn by LINK Pecunia
        and the costs associated with the acquisition of LINK Mobility Group AS by LINK Pecunia. Accordingly, there are
        limitations in the comparability of following line items in the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statement and the 2018
        Financial Statement as compared to the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and the Condensed Interim Financial
        Statements: other operating expenses; depreciation and amortisation; total finance income (expense); income tax; total
        non-current assets, and total non-current liabilities. Therefore, undue reliance should not be placed on the comparability
        of these line items in the Prospectus. See Section 11 "Operating and financial review". For description of impact on the
        line items, see Section 11.7 "Comparison of results for the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to
        six months ended 30 June 2019".                                           
        In addition, the Group has had an active M&A strategy as part of its growth strategy. The M&A strategy has continued
        to be a key driver for growth under the Company’s ownership. Since 2017 the Group has completed 16 strategic
        acquisitions. See Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions". These acquisitions limit the comparability of the Consolidated Financial
        Statements and the Condensed Interim Financial Statements. See Section 2.3.3 "The Group's complex operating history
        makes it difficult to evaluate and forecast the Group's future results of operations".
        The selected financial information included herein should be read in connection with, and is qualified in its entirety by
        reference to, the Financial Statements, which are attached as appendices to this Prospectus.
        10.1  Key accounting principles, estimates and judgments                  
        For a description of the principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial
        statements, see note 3 to the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements attached as Appendix C to this Prospectus, see
        Section 19.3 "Documents on display".                                      
        The preparation of the Group’s accounts requires the Group's management to make estimates and assumptions that
        affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Management bases its estimates and judgments
        on experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are considered reasonable
        under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments are continually reviewed and are based on historical experiences
        and expectations of future events. The resulting accounting estimates will seldom accurately match actual results but
        are based on the best estimate at the time. For a description of the critical accounting judgments management has
        made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, see note 3 to the 2019 Consolidated Financial
        Statements attached as Appendix C to this Prospectus, see Section 19.3 "Documents on display".

         3 Represents the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements.                 
         4 The increase in the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements as compared to the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements is mainly due to the recognition
           of Goodwill and other intangible assets as part of the purchase price allocation in connection with the acquisition of Link Mobility Group AS in October
           2018 by the Company for a total consideration of NOK 3,396.4 million. For a discussion on the limitations on the comparability of these results, see
           Section 4.2.2 "Factors affecting comparability of results".            
         5 The increase in the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements as compared to the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements is mainly due to (i) the increase
           in long-term borrowings, which is primarily due to the drawings under the Senior Facilities Agreement incurred by LINK Pecunia and (ii) the increase in
           deferred tax liabilities, which is primarily due to the tax effect of intangible assets in connection with the purchase price allocation related to the
           acquisition of LINK Mobility Group AS by the Company (through LINK Pecunia). For a discussion on the limitations on the comparability of these results,
           see Section 4.2.2 "Factors affecting comparability of results".        
         6 The increase in the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements as compared to the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements is partly due to short-term
           borrowings, which is primarily due to the short-term drawings under the Senior Facilities Agreement incurred by LINK Pecunia. For a discussion on the
           limitations on the comparability of these results, see Section 4.2.2 "Factors affecting comparability of results".

                   (a)   Acquisition Revenue is defined as revenue generated by the acquired entities for the periods indicated. The Company
                         considers Acquisition Revenue any revenue generated by acquired entities for four full consecutive quarters after
                         complete ownership by the Company of such entity. From 1 January 2018 an acquired Spanish entity was merged
                         with an existing entity, hence the allocation of revenues between organic and acquired revenue is based on a
                         management estimate. In 2017 an acquired Danish entity was merged with an existing Danish entity, hence the
                         allocation between organic and acquired revenue is estimated. See Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions".
                   (b)   When comparing the Like-for-Like Revenue for a relevant period, the entities used for such calculation differ from
                         period to period, as the Company excludes revenues from companies acquired during the relevant periods in
                         calculating Like-for-Like Revenue. This methodology allows the Company to isolate and compare the revenue
                         generated by the companies that were operating for the full relevant period compared. See Section 11.3.2
                         "Acquisitions".                                          
                         When comparing the years ended 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2019, the Company excludes revenues from
                         companies acquired in 2019 and 2018, but includes the revenue from companies acquired in 2017, as the Company
                         no longer considers such revenue as Acquisition Revenue. The growth rate of Like-for-Like Revenue for the years
                         ended 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2019 increased from 1,956.9 to 2,128.7, an increase of 9%.
                         When comparing the years ended 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2018, the Company excludes revenues from
                         companies acquired in 2017 and 2018. The growth rate of Like-for-Like Revenue for the years ended 31 December
                         2017 to 31 December 2018 increased from 1,255.4 to 1,387.9, an increase of 11%.
           6   Gross Profit Conversion is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Gross Profit.
           7   Revenue Net Retention Rate is defined as revenue from the net of upsale, downsale and churn for customers throughout the period, not
               taking into account new customers during the year. Revenue Net Retention Rate excludes the acquisitions of TeraComm Group and Spothit.
               Excluding Spain, these figures are 116% and 111% for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and as of 31 December 2020, respectively. The
               data required to calculate these measures was not yet monitored in the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 and as a result
               comparatives for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 are not available.
           8   Churn Rate is defined as revenue of customers that were a customer in the prior period but were not a customer at the beginning of the
               current period divided by the total revenue of the prior period. The data required to calculate these measures was not yet monitored in the
               years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 and as a result comparatives for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 are not available.
           9   Net Customer Expansion Rate is defined as the revenue generated from customers at the end of the period with their corresponding revenue
               from the same period in the previous year.

        11    OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW                                      
        Consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared for the reporting period covering the years ended
        31 December 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the six months period ended 30 June 2020 in accordance with IFRS, as adopted
        by the European Union. See Section 4.2.1 "Financial information in the Prospectus" for a description of the Financial
        Statements.                                                               
        The reporting entity of the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and the Condensed Interim Financial Statements is
        the Company. The reporting entity of the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and 2017 Consolidated Financial
        Statements is the Company’s subsidiary LINK Mobility Group AS, a company that was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange
        until completion of the Take-over in October 2018 whereby it was acquired by the Company. See Section 4.2.1 "Financial
        information in the Prospectus" for a description of the Financial Statements and Section 8.1 "Introduction" for a
        description of the Take-over.                                             
        As set out in Section 4.2.1 "Financial information in the Prospectus", the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements have
        been prepared for the purpose of the Offering and this Prospectus. A reader should note that as a consequence of the
        difference in reporting entity, the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2018 Consolidated Financial
        Statements are not fully comparable.                                      
        The main differences between the consolidated financial information of the Company and LINK Mobility Group AS'
        statement of financial position are higher non-current assets in the Company mainly attributable to recognition of
        Goodwill and other intangible assets as part of the purchase price allocation in connection with the acquisition of LINK
        Mobility Group AS, as well as higher non-current liabilities in the Company due to the borrowing held at Company level
        in connection with the refinancing of LINK Mobility Group AS and increasing its borrowings through the SFA. The main
        differences between the consolidated financial information of the Company and LINK Mobility Group AS’ income
        statements are higher amortisation in the Company due to the effects of the recognition of other intangible assets as
        part of the purchase price allocation in connection with the acquisition of LINK Mobility Group AS, as well as higher net
        finance expenses in the Company due to the interests on the Senior Facilities Agreement held at Company level.
        Therefore, undue reliance should not be placed on the comparability of these line items in the Prospectus. See Section
        4.2.2 "Factors affecting comparability of results" for further description of the factors affecting the comparability of the
        2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and undue reliance should not
        be placed on the comparability of the line items described therein in the Prospectus.
        The selected financial information included herein should be read in connection with, and is qualified in its entirety by
        reference to, the Financial Statements, which are attached as appendices to this Prospectus, and the related notes
        included elsewhere in this Prospectus.                                    
        The financial information included in this Prospectus includes measures which are not accounting measures as defined
        by IFRS. These measures have been included for the reasons described below. However, these measures should not be
        used instead of, or considered as alternatives to, the Group’s historical financial results based on IFRS. Further, these
        measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies. See 11.10 "Non-IFRS
        financial measures and other key performance indicators" and 4.2.3 "General information - Presentation of financial and
        other information - Non-IFRS financial measures".

        11.1  Overview

        headquartered in Oslo, Norway. LINK assists enterprise, SME and government customers in providing mobile solutions
        for their end-customers and users. LINK is headquartered in Oslo, Norway. The Group was founded in 2001 and its

        In 2007, the Group acquired LINK Messaging AB, a voice services company founded in 1995. Over time, the Group has
        grown and evolved its business model into an omni-channel messaging and mobile technology platform leveraging CPaaS
        functionality to deliver efficient, automated solutions spanning across functions that are mission critical in customer’s
        operations including customer service, customer engagement, marketing, notifications and payments amongst several
        others.                                                                   
        Since its creation, the Group has expanded its business both organically and through acquisitions. For further information
        on the recent acquisitions made by the Group see Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions". These acquisitions increased LINK's

        Other than the factors described in this Section "Key factors affecting the Group’s results of operations", the Group does

        information regarding any governmental, economic, fiscal, tax, monetary or political policies or factors that could
        materially affect, directly or indirectly, the Group’s operations in the future.
        11.3.1 Outbreak of COVID-19                                               
        In March 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group promptly undertook a number of initiatives
        to safeguard its employees and reduce operating costs while ensuring the continuity of the Group’s operations. In
        particular, the Group successfully transitioned substantially all of its employees to remote working over a short period
        of time while at the same time maintaining the full operation of all its centres, which are equipped with continuity and
        backup systems, full-service delivery of the Group’s services and complete business continuity services. The Group is
                                        58                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        currently in the process of re-opening its offices in all the countries it operates, following local authorities’ instructions
        and regulations. The Group’s long-term partnerships with customers, its ability to pivot, reset and refocus on key
        production areas across a wide geographical footprint provides resilience in challenging times.
        Since the start of the outbreak of the pandemic, the Group has experienced an increase in customer demand for
        digitalisation products and services, as businesses have been forced to rely on IT infrastructures and systems and have
        turned to remote working and cloud-based solutions to run their operations. Leveraging the Group’s significant
        experience and digital solutions portfolio as well as its existing workforce, the Group assisted new and existing customers
        in their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including in connection with digital transformation projects, digital
        workplace solutions, cloud-based solutions and business continuity solutions. For example, the Group has assisted
        government authorities in several European countries (e.g., Bulgaria, France, Norway, Poland, the United Kingdom) on
        various digital solution projects and assisted various European retailers on facilitating digital communication with their
        customers. Furthermore, the Group has experienced recent reductions in SMS volumes from customers in countries
        and/or regions that have implemented material business closures as a result of COVID-19. In quarters ended
        31 December 2019, 31 March 2020 and 30 June 2020, the Company delivered 2.9 billion messages, 2.6 billion messages
        and 2.4 billion messages respectively.                                    
        While the Group anticipates long-term trends as a results of COVID-19 to positively impact its business, the extent to
        which COVID-19 impacts the Group’s future results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and
        cannot be predicted, including new information, which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions
        taken to contain it or treat its impact. See Section 2.1.8 "The Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash
        flows and financial position may be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic".
        11.3.2 Acquisitions                                                       
        The Group has historically driven growth through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. It is part of the
        Group's growth strategy to look to use acquisitions as a way to further expand or enhance the range of services that it
        offers as well as its technological capabilities, and to improve its presence in strategic European geographies. See Section
        2.1.1 "The Group may not be able to implement its M&A strategy successfully or manage its growth effectively".

        Netmessage (France)

        11.3.3 General economic conditions                                        
        The level of IT spending by the Group’s existing and potential customers is influenced by general economic conditions
        in the countries in which the Group operates. As many of the Group’s customers, particularly its large customers, are
        European companies, economic conditions in Europe may affect the demand for the Group’s solutions and services and
        the pricing it is able to agree on in respect of its contracts. Volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions in the
        Group’s customers’ markets have in the past undermined, and could in the future undermine, business confidence and
        cause customers to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, or may result in customers
        reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts or putting pressure on pricing. In Europe, there are
        large addressable IT services markets that provide the Group with the opportunity to continue to increase its market
        share. See Section 7 "Industry and market overview" for further details. These markets are significant markets for the
        Group’s customers and, accordingly, economic conditions in each of these countries are particularly important to the
        Group’s business. Furthermore, certain countries may adopt legislation that will block certain software applications which
        might reduce business confidence and reduce or eliminate spending under certain contracts.
        As a service provider to public sector customers, the Group is also impacted by financial, budgetary, regulatory or
        political constraints, or changes in government policy and public spending constraints which could have a significant
        impact on the size, scope, timing and duration of contracts and orders placed by them and, therefore, on the level of
        business which the Group will derive from such customers.                 
        11.3.4 Trends within the IT industry                                      
        Trends within the IT industry can affect the overall level of demand for IT services and, accordingly, have an effect on
        the Group’s sales. As technology has developed and become more sophisticated, there has been an increasing desire to
        incorporate IT within almost all business processes within all industries and this has increased demand for the types of
        services and solutions the Group offers. The Group expects that new technologies and new applications of existing
        technologies will continue to be developed and support the continued demand for IT services.
        11.3.5 The growth of the CpaaS market and demand for the Group’s services 
        The Group believes that the general shift from traditional communications and payments services to an integrated,
        modern, software-driven, cloud-based, conversational commerce platform has just begun, and that its products and
        services platform, enables the customers to optimise the mobile communications journey with their consumers, positions
        the Group to capitalise on this trend. The Group markets its services to large corporate enterprises, government agencies
        and non-profit organisations that want to leverage the Group’s platforms as a part of their own consumer service offering.
        The Group believes that the demand for advanced communications and payments services will continue to grow, in turn
        contributing to the Group’s growth.                                       
        The demand for the Group’s services is primarily driven by (i) the growth in customers using the Group’s messaging and
        payment services and related technological and consumer behaviour trends, (ii) the Group’s ability to retain existing
        customers and win new customer accounts and expand their use of the full suite of services offered through the Group’s
        products and services platform, as well as (iii) the roll-out of new solutions.
        The Group’s business and results of operations will depend on its ability to grow its business with existing customers
        and to continue to add new customers. Customers may scale their usage of the Group’s products and services rapidly,
        which may cause fluctuations in the Group’s results of operations and financial metrics and make forecasting future
        results of operations and financial metrics more difficult. The Group believes there is a significant opportunity to drive
        additional sales to existing customers, and has invested in its sales, marketing and customer support teams. In this
        respect, the Group believes that it has a strong track record in retaining existing customers and achieving incremental
                                        62                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        revenue growth from such customers, demonstrated by a 111% Revenue Net Retention Rate in the six months ended
        30 June 2020 and 106% in the year ended 31 December 2019.                 
                                                                                  
        11.3.6 Direct relationships with mobile network operators, OTT-providers and financial services providers
        The Group’s direct relationships with mobile network operators, OTT-providers and financial services providers have a
        significant impact on the Group’s results of operations. The Group’s ability to source certain CPaaS and payments services
        can drive demand for The Group’s services, reduce the cost of services and provide a competitive advantage in certain
        markets. The Group has generally experienced a positive correlation between the number of its direct relationships and
        growth in revenue and gross margin.                                       
        In addition, certain CPaaS services provided by the Group require direct relationships with OTT providers. The contracts
        with the OTT providers enable the Group to supplement its traditional CPaaS messaging and voice services with OTT
        communication services and offer its customers omni-channel communication capabilities, thereby providing the Group
        with a competitive advantage vis-à-vis traditional CPaaS providers. In addition, the Group’s omni-channel
        communication capabilities also allow the Group to mitigate its communication services supplier risk and manage its
        communication-related cost of services as it can shift its messaging and voice services to different communication
        channels.                                                                 
        11.3.7 Platform costs and operating expenses                              
        The Group believes that to expand its business, it needs to continue to invest in development of its products and services.
        As its products and services have been primarily built in-house, it expects to continue to make significant investments
        in research and development activities that will enable the Group not to rely significantly on any third-party systems or
        service providers to provide its products and services and, consequently, to not make significant investments in
        integrating and maintaining third-party systems or resolving legacy system issues. The Group expects to realise cost
        savings through economies of scale, but may incur costs during phases of expansion and optimisation. For information
        relating to the Group's investments reference is made to Section 11.14 "Investments".
        11.3.8 Exchange rates                                                     
        The Group undertakes business in foreign currencies and is consequently exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates.
        Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions related to operations conducted, and assets and liabilities arising in
        foreign currencies. The Group undertakes transactions denominated in NOK, SEK, DKK, EUR, GBP, BGN, CHF, RON, MKD
        and PLN. Revenue and cost transactions within foreign subsidiaries are normally carried out in the same currency, which
        mitigates the currency risk. The Group has no hedging arrangements. See Section 2.3.2 "Currency fluctuations could
        affect the Group’s cash flow and financial condition".                    
        However, as the Group's overall financial reporting is presented in NOK, changes in the value of SEK, DKK, EUR, GBP,
        BGN, CHF, RON, MKD or PLN in relation to NOK affect the Group’s overall revenue, profit or loss and financial position.
        Based on exposure throughout the year and balances at the period-end, the Group assesses that fluctuations in
        NOK/EUR, NOK/DKK and NOK/SEK have the most significant impact on the financial reporting of financial assets and
        liabilities.                                                              
        For the year ended 31 December 2019, 80% of the Group’s revenue were generated in a currency other than the NOK.

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        11.4  The Group's 2020 outlook                                            
        11.4.1 Introduction                                                       
        The Group’s future growth will depend on the successful implementation of the Group’s business strategy. The Group’s
        ability to achieve its business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the
        Group’s control. The forecasts included in this Prospectus have been prepared by the Company to give guidance into
        how management views the Group’s expected financial performance for the financial year ending 31 December 2020.
        The profit forecasts has been compiled and prepared on a basis which is both comparable with the historical financial
        information and consistent with the issuers' accounting policies. The outlook statements are forward looking statements
        and carry the risk associated therewith (see Section 4.3 "Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" and
        Section 2.3.4 "The Group's future results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied by the forecast of
        consolidated financial information included in this Prospectus, and investors should not place undue reliance on this
        information").                                                            
        The Group's 2020 outlook included in this Prospectus has been prepared by, and are the sole responsibility of the
        Company's management. PricewaterhouseCoopers AS has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied
        agreed-upon procedures with respect to the Group’s 2020 outlook, and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers AS does
        not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. PricewaterhouseCoopers AS reports included
        in the Prospectus relate solely to the Company's previously issued consolidated financial statements. They do not extend
        to the Group’s 2020 outlook and should not be read to do so.              
        11.4.2 Methodology and assumptions                                        
        The outlook of consolidated financial information for the financial year ending 31 December 2020 has been prepared on
        the basis of the accounting policies set out in note 3 of the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements. The outlook for
        2020 has been prepared for the purpose of this Offering in accordance with the Group's ordinary forecasting procedures
        and on a basis comparable to the historical financial information included elsewhere in this Offering. However, the
        forecast of consolidated financial information is based on a large number of estimates made by the Group based on
        assumptions about future events, which are subject to numerous and significant uncertainties, for example, caused by
        business and/or wider economic risks and uncertainties, which could cause the Company's actual results to differ
        materially from the forecast of financial targets presented herein. Certain of the assumptions, uncertainties and
        contingencies relating to the forecast of consolidated financial information and the projections of consolidated financial
        targets are wholly or partially within the Group's control, while others are outside or substantially outside of its control.
        11.4.3 Key management assumptions that can be influenced by management    
        The Group’s target for reported revenue growth measured in NOK is based on the following key assumptions that can
        be influenced by management: (i) growth from new contracts are estimated on a normalised basis meaning that the
        outlook does not assume revenue streams from single material contracts which have not been signed at the time of
        modelling; and (ii) the Group assumes no M&A transactions in the financial forecast.
        11.4.4 Key management assumptions outside of management’s influence       
        The Group’s target for reported revenue growth measured in NOK is based on the following key assumptions that are
        outside of management’s control: (i) Exchange rate assumptions are based on stable Exchange rates based on average
        rates during the first six months of 2020; (ii) stable macroeconomic situation across the Group's footprint; and (iii) the
        Group assumes low customer concentration and hence no loss of single major contracts that will impact the Group's
        financial performance.                                                    
        11.4.5 Key management assumptions that could materially change the outcome of the forecasts
        The Group’s target for reported revenue growth measured in NOK is based on the following key assumptions that could
        materially change the outcome of the forecasts: (i) growth rates from existing customers are modelled according to
        historical growth rates and amended with expected future trends based on management’s best judgment; (ii) in regards
        to COVID-19, it is assumed that societies remain fairly open and that no material lockdown measures as observed in
        March to June are implemented during second half of 2020 in the Group’s core geographies. Material lockdown measures
        will impact marketing messaging volumes directly; (iii) no material changes to legislation impacting the Group’s ability
        to deliver services efficiently across its regions; and (iv) the Group assumes mobile network operators maintains a
        predictable pricing regime and no material price increases limiting demand for the Group’s services across its customer
        base.                                                                     
        11.4.6 Other key management assumptions                                   
        The Group’s target for reported revenue growth measured in NOK is also based on the following key assumptions: (i)
        existing footprint, no M&A activities included; (ii) revenue growth rates and gross margins are modelled per country and
        summarised on a regional level; (iii) the outlook for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 is based on internal
        management figures up to June 2020 and a forecast for the period from July to December 2020; and (iv) assumptions
        are based on historical trends and run-rate per country and adapted to expected future trends. Expected future trends
        are based on management’s best judgment.                                  
        11.4.7 Key management assumptions per region for revenue and gross margin 
        Nordic region                                                             
        Revenue assumptions: Overall growth rate for the region is assumed to show a moderate decline from 16% in the first
        half of 2020 driven by the extraordinary strong first half results in Norway resulting from additional information
        messaging volumes connected to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sweden experienced a very strong development for second
        half 2019 and management has forecasted lower growth rates in second half 2020, compared to the underlying growth
        in the first half of 2020. In Denmark and Finland, management expects pick-up in growth rates driven by softer
                                        64                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        comparable in the second half of 2019 for Denmark, while Finland had a soft start to 2020 and management has assumed
        a pick-up in growth rates late in 2020.                                   
                                                                                  
        Gross Margin assumptions: Management assumes fairly stable margins overall for the full year in the region with normal
        seasonality with lower margins in the fourth quarter of 2020, as a higher portion of the volume derives from high volume
        but lower margin customers due to campaigns in connection with the Christmas season. Management assumes Gross
        Margin to be slightly reduced for the year ending 31 December 2020 as a result of customer mix as high volume but
        lower margin customers constituting a larger portion of the growth in volumes and thereby diluting margins slightly. The
        negative effect on gross margin from customer mix outweighs the increased margins from positive product mix.
        Central region                                                            
        Revenue assumptions: Overall growth rates for the region are assumed to decrease in the second half compared to first
        half of 2020 as the acquisition of the TeraComm Group in August 2019 becomes part of the organic footprint while
        underlying business excluding acquisitions is expected to maintain a stable growth rate in line with the year ended
        31 December 2019. The revenue momentum in Germany is strongly linked to industries like logistics and e-commerce
        which experience a volume increase from COVID-19. Management also expects a rebound in messaging volumes and
        activity in markets like Bulgaria, Romania and Poland although recovery has been slower than for the Western Europe
        region. Management has forecasted lower mobile payments revenue in Bulgaria and Romania for the remaining months
        in 2020 due to COVID-19. Due to the revenue streams in Bulgaria and Romania, lower gross margin will have limited
        impact on Group’s profitability.                                          
        Gross Margin assumptions: Management assumes gross margin will remain stable compared to the financial year ended
        31 December 2019 based on current trends. Stabilisation of Germany’s gross margin through the second quarter 2020
        has been key to set an assumption of stable margin development.           
        Western region                                                            
        Revenues assumptions: Overall growth rate for the region is assumed to decline from the 21% level in the first half of
        2020 as Spot-Hit becomes part of the organic footprint. The outlook assumes continued fairly open societies in countries
        which were mostly impacted by severe lockdown measures during the first half of 2020 (Italy, France and Spain). The
        assumed growth rates for second half of 2020 are in line with reported growth rates before COVID-19 negatively
        impacted growth rates from April.                                         
        Gross Margin assumptions: Overall management assumes stable margin development in the region with a margin decline
        in entities like Netmessage and Spot Hit from customer mix and quality measures. In entities like Spain and Netsize
        management has assumed expanded margins from healthier customer and country mix and new products.
        Global messaging                                                          
        Revenue assumptions: Growth rates on global messaging are assumed to decline in the second half of 2020 primarily
        due to lower aggregator revenue. The Group observes that volume thresholds that enable discounts from the mobile
        operators on certain destinations will be met to a larger extent compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019
        by enterprise traffic, thus resulting in reduced aggregator volumes. The reduction on aggregator volumes will have close
        to zero impact on gross margin, as the profitability is very low for the relevant destinations. The Group expects to
        continue to experience healthy growth in their Global Enterprises business through expansion of their business to new
        destinations for P2A messaging volumes. Growth rates can be volatile in global messaging while gross margin sensitivity
        is limited due to the lower margin level, especially for aggregator customers.
        Gross Margin assumptions: Gross margin is assumed to slightly decline for the year ending 31 December 2020 compared
        to the financial year ended 31 December 2019. The decline is mainly driven by the highly competitive aggregator
        landscape with competition pushing traffic at a loss margin, especially during the second quarter of 2020. As the Group
        moves away from the most competitive routes, management expects Gross Margins to improve during the second half
        of 2020.                                                                  
        11.4.8 The Group's 2020 outlook                                           
        Revenue                                                                   
        The Group’s total revenue for the year ending 31 December 2020 is forecasted to be in the range of NOK 3,500 – 3,600
        million.                                                                  
        Gross Margin                                                              
        The Group’s total Gross Margin for the year ending 31 December 2020 is forecasted in the range 24.2% – 24.7% of total
        revenues.                                                                 
        Adjusted EBITDA6                                                          
        For the year ending 31 December 2020, the Group forecasts the Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of NOK 360 million
        – NOK 370 million.                                                        
        6 For the purpose of this Section 11.4.8, Adjusted EBITDA is derived from operating profit (loss) and defined as operating profit (loss)
        added back depreciation and amortization and adjusted for M&A activities costs and restructuring costs and other. M&A activities costs
        are mainly related to consultant and legal advisors expenses incurred in connection with acquisition of subsidiaries. Restructuring costs
        and other are mainly related to (i) efficiency projects, start-up costs for new businesses and branding/rebranding costs in connection with
        the acquisition of subsidiaries and (ii) severance paid to certain employees as a result of acquisition of subsidiaries and changes in the
        Group’s strategic focus also including certain replacement/rehiring cost. See also Section 4.2.3 "Non-IFRS financial measures".

        11.4.9 Capital expenditures                                               
        For the year ending 31 December 2020, the Group forecasts capital expenditure levels at NOK 95 million – NOK 105
        million as the Group continues to invest in CPaaS innovation and LINK Suite capabilities which will differentiate the
        business in the long-term.                                                
        11.4.10 Medium-to-long term outlook                                       
        From 2017 to 2019, the Company recorded a 51% CAGR in revenue driven by both organic growth and M&A activity.
        The Company is targeting continued strong revenue growth in the medium-to-long term, fuelled by increased customer
        and market penetration, investments in go-to market initialise, continued expansion of the CPaaS platform and M&A
        strategy. If such sustained growth is achieved, the Company will realize its medium-to-long term revenue target of
        NOK 10 billion. In addition, the Company intends to achieve incremental growth in Gross Margins due to increased
        revenue mix of higher value-add solutions and software, partially offset by growing mix of Western and Central European
        revenues.                                                                 
        From 2017 to 2019, the Company recorded a 55% CAGR in EBITDA. The Company is targeting continued strong EBITDA
        growth in the medium-to-long term, with growth investments in the CPaaS platform and GTM initiatives expected to
        drive a slight decline in EBITDA Margin. In the longer term, the Company is targeting net debt to Adjusted EBITDA below
        3.0x. Capital expenditure levels are targeted to stay between NOK 100 million and NOK 125 million, as the Company
        continues to invest in CPaaS innovation and LINK Suite capabilities which will differentiate the business in the long-term.

        Further, on 24 September 2020, the Company’s general meeting resolved to redeem the Company’s class of preference
        shares, resulting in a share capital decrease of NOK 12,915.80 and the Company having a share capital of
        NOK 1,070,993.70, divided on 214.198.740 Shares and the Company only having one class of ordinary shares. The
        share capital decrease was registered with the Norwegian Register of Enterprises on 2 October 2020, see Section 13.3
        "Share capital and share capital history".

         2 Nordics include Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Baltics.          
         3 Central Europe includes Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and North Macedonia.

        Revenue was NOK 854.5 million for the three months ended 30 June 2020 compared to NOK 683.7 million for the three
        months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 25.0%. This increase was primarily a result of organic growth and
        acquisitions during the year ended 30 December 2019. The organic growth was driven by the expansion of the Group’s
        customer base and stable revenue intake from existing customers, while additional acquisition revenue was recorded
        due to the integration of Teracomm and Spot-Hit in the Group’s business structure following the acquisitions in July and
        August 2019 respectively. During this period the Group also increased the price its products and solutions, further
        contributing to revenue growth. Furthermore, the fluctuations in NOK/EUR, NOK/SEK and NOK/DKK exchange rates also
        influenced the revenue growth, see Section 4.2.5 "Exchange rates". This growth in revenue was partially offset by lower
        revenues in Spain and the negative impact of lower volumes in certain markets due to COVID-19 in the three months
        ended 30 June 2020.                                                       
        In the Nordics, the revenue was NOK 276.5 million for the three months ended 30 June 2020 compared to NOK 240.3
        million for the three months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 15.1%. The increase was primarily driven by higher
        usage of Group’s products from the existing customers as well as the price increase in the region.
        In Central Europe, the revenue was NOK 192.7 million for the three months ended 30 June 2020 compared to NOK 135.4
        million for the three months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 42.3%. The increase was driven by the acquisition of
        Teracomm Group in Bulgaria, see Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions" and strong growth in Germany driven by customers
        within ecommerce and logistic sector.                                     
        In Western Europe, the revenue was NOK 261.8 million for the three months ended 30 June 2020 compared to
        NOK 226.9 million for the three months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 15.4%. The increase was primarily driven
        by the acquisition of Spot-hit in France, see Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions" and organic growth in France and Italy.
        In Global Messaging segment, the revenue was NOK 123.4 million for the three months ended 30 June 2020 compared
        to NOK 81.1 million for the three months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 52.3%. The growth was driven by growth
        in aggregator traffic and growth in password verification services provided to the Group’s global customers.
        11.6.2 Cost of services rendered                                          
        Cost of services rendered was NOK 634.1 million for the three months ended 30 June 2020, compared to NOK 501.6
        million for the three months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 26.4%. This increase was primarily as a result of volume
        increase and acquisitions that have been operationally consolidated within the Group. Namely, the growth in the number
        of customers both organically and through acquisitions has resulted in an increase of the cost of services rendered.

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        11.6.3 Payroll and related expenses                                       
        Payroll and related expenses were NOK 92.0 million for the three months ended 30 June 2020 compared to NOK 86.5
        million for the three months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 6.3%. This increase was mainly related to the increases
        in wages and salaries primarily due to the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, which was partly offset
        by the synergies extraction from the integration of recently acquired companies.
        11.6.4 Other operating expenses                                           
        Other operating expenses were NOK 41.4 million for the three months ended 30 June 2020, compared to NOK 52.9
        million for the three months ended 30 June 2019, a decrease of NOK 21.8%. This decrease was primarily a result of
        reduction in restructuring costs and in costs related to acquisitions as a result of lower activity during the COVID-19
        pandemic lock-down. Restructuring costs decreased compared to the same period last year. This decrease was mainly
        due to the completion of acquisition synergies, as well as lower M&A activities, which reduced the need for restructuring
        programs and related costs during the three months ended 30 June 2020. Namely, in the three months ended 30 June
        2019, the restructuring costs were NOK 29.6 million and in the three months ended 30 June 2020, the restructuring
        costs were NOK 10.8 million.                                              
        11.6.5 Depreciation and amortisation                                      
        Depreciation and amortisation was NOK 55.7 million for the three months ended 30 June 2020, compared to NOK 51.8
        million for the three months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 7.6%. This increase was primarily due to the
        depreciation and amortisation costs related to the acquisition of the Teracomm Group and Spot-Hit during second half
        2019.                                                                     
        11.6.6 Total operating expenses                                           
        Total operating expenses were NOK 823.1 million for the three months ended 30 June 2020 compared to NOK 692.8
        million for the three months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 18.8%. This increase was primarily a result of organic
        and acquired growth in messaging volumes that increased the total operating expenses, while personnel, other operating
        expenses and depreciations remained fairly stable compared to same period last year.
        11.6.7 Operating profit (loss)                                            
        Primarily as a result of the factors described above, the Group's operating profit for the three months ended 30 June
        2020 was NOK 31.3 million compared to an operating loss of NOK 9.1 million loss for the three months ended 30 June
        2019, an increase of 444.7%, resulting in the Group recording Gross Margin of 26% and 27% for the three months
        ended 30 June 2020 and 2019.                                              
        11.6.8 Total finance income (expense)                                     
        Finance income for the three months ended 30 June 2020 was NOK 56.5 million, compared to NOK 50.8 million expense
        for the three months ended 30 June 2019. The increase in finance expenses was primarily a result of the increase in the
        cash draws under the Senior Facilities Agreement, as well as foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
        11.6.9 Income tax                                                         
        Total tax expenses were NOK 16.3 million for the three months ended 30 June 2020, compared to an income tax expense
        of NOK 0.8 million for the three months ended 30 June 2019.               
        11.6.10 Profit (loss)                                                     
        As a result of the factors described above, the profit for the three months ended 30 June 2020 was NOK 71.5 million,
        compared to a loss of NOK 60.7 million for the three months ended 30 June 2019.
        11.7  Comparison of results for the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to six
              months ended 30 June 2019

         3 Central Europe includes Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and North Macedonia.

        Revenue was NOK 1.7 billion for the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to NOK 1.3 billion for the six months
        ended 30 June 2019. This increase was primarily as a result of organic growth and acquisitions during the year 2019.
        The organic growth was driven by the expansion of the Group’s customer base and stable revenue intake from the
        existing customers as well as the full integration of Netsize in the Group’s business structure following its acquisition in
        January 2019. During this period, the Group also increased the price of its products and solutions, further contributing
        to revenue growth. This growth is also partly as a result of the introduction of new products such as Verified SMS and
        LINK Live Chat during the six months ended 30 June 2020. Furthermore, the fluctuations in NOK/EUR, NOK/SEK and
        NOK/DKK exchange rates have also influenced the revenue growth, "General information - Presentation of financial and
        other information - Exchange rates". This growth in revenue was partially offset by lower revenues in Spain and the
        negative impact of lower volumes in the second quarter of 2020 due to COVID-19.
        In the Nordics, the revenue was NOK 545.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to NOK 468.4
        million for the six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 16.4%. The increase was primarily driven by higher usage
        from the existing customers as well as the price increase in the region.  
        In Central Europe, the revenue was NOK 374.2 million for the three months ended 30 June 2020 compared to
        NOK 272.3 million for the three months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 37.4%. The increase was primarily driven
        by the acquisition of Teracomm Group in Bulgaria (see Section 11.14.3 "Acquisitions") and an increase in volumes due
        to COVID-19.                                                              
        In Western Europe, the revenue was NOK 534.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to NOK 441.9
        million for the six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 20.9%. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition
        of Spot.it in Italy (see Section 11.14.3 "Acquisitions".                  
        In Global Messaging segment, the revenue was NOK 264.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to
        NOK 153.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 71.9%. The growth was primarily driven by
        high volumes in the aggregator business and growth of password verification services provided to the Group’s global
        customers.                                                                
        11.7.2 Direct cost of services rendered                                   
        Direct cost of services rendered was NOK 1,288.3 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020, compared to
        NOK 980.8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 31.4%. This increase was primarily as a result
        of volume increase and acquisitions that have been operationally consolidated within the Group. Namely, the growth in
        the number of customers both organically and through acquisitions has resulted in an increase of the cost of services
        rendered.

        Payroll and related expenses were NOK 180.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to NOK 168.6
        million for the six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 6.9%. This increase was mainly related to the increases
        in wages and salaries primarily due to the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, which was partly offset
        by the synergies extraction from the integration of recently acquired companies.

        1 Represents the Six Months Condensed Interim Financial Statements.       
        Other operating expenses were NOK 89.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020, compared to NOK 103.3 million
        for the six months ended 30 June 2019, a decrease of 13.8%. This decrease was primarily a result of reduction in
        restructuring costs and in costs related to acquisitions as a result of lower activity during the COVID-19 pandemic lock-
        down. Restructuring costs decreased compared to the same period last year. This decrease was mainly due to the
        completion of acquisition synergies, as well as lower M&A activities, which reduced the need for restructuring programs
        and related costs during the first half of 2020. Namely, in the six months ended 30 June 2019, the Restructuring costs
        and Cost related to acquisition of subsidiaries were NOK 14.8 million and NOK 15.6 million respectively and in the six
        months ended 30 June 2020, the Restructuring costs and Cost related to acquisition of subsidiaries were NOK 3.2 million
        and NOK 3.3 million respectively.                                         
        11.7.5 Depreciation and amortisation                                      
        Depreciation and amortisation was NOK 107.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020, compared to NOK 103.0
        million for the six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 4.4%. This increase was primarily due to the depreciation
        and amortisation costs related to the Netsize acquisition made in January 2019.
        11.7.6 Total operating expenses                                           
        Total operating expenses were NOK 1.67 billion for the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to NOK 1.36 billion
        for the six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 22.8%. The increase in finance expenses was primarily a result
        of the increase in the Group’s indebtedness and cash draws under the Senior Facilities Agreement, as well as foreign
        exchange rate fluctuations.                                               
        11.7.7 Operating profit (loss)                                            
        Primarily as a result of the factors described above, the Group's operating profit for the six months ended 30 June 2020
        was NOK 52.5 million compared to an operating loss of NOK 19.6 million loss for the six months ended 30 June 2019,
        resulting in the Group recording Gross Margin of 25% and 27% for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019. For
        six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019, Gross Margin for the Nordics was 32% and 33%, respectively; for Central
        Europe was 25% and 27%, respectively; for Western Europe was 26% and 24%, respectively; and for Global Messaging
        was 9% and 13%, respectively.

        six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 347.8%. This increase was primarily as a result of unrealised losses on
        the Senior Facilities Agreement tranches denominated in EUR from fluctuations in currency rates and an increase in
        interest expenses on borrowings.

        NOK 294.5 million, compared to NOK 54.9 million expense for the six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of
        436.4%.

        Revenue was NOK 2,932.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to NOK 1,972.0 million for the year
        ended 31 December 2018, an increase of 48.7%. This increase was primarily as a result of organic growth and
        acquisitions during the year 2019. The organic growth was driven by the expansion of the Group’s customer base and
        stable revenue intake from the existing customers as well as the full integration of Netsize, Spot-hit and TeraComm
        Group in the Group’s business structure following their acquisitions. This growth is also partly as a result of the
        introduction of new products such as WhatsApp for Business in 2019. Furthermore, following the GDPR compliance
        related costs and data protection related adjustments that temporarily offset the revenue growth in 2018, the Group’s
        revenue increased in 2019 as the Group became fully GDPR compliant.       
        For the year ended 31 December 2019, Like-for-Like Revenue was NOK 2.1 billion (equal to 73.2% of the revenue for
        such period) compared to NOK 1.4 billion for the year ended 31 December 2018 (equal to 72.3% of the revenue for
        such period). See Section 4.2.3 "Non-IFRS financial measures".            
        In the Nordics, the revenue was NOK 980.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to NOK 915.6 million
        for the year ended 31 December 2018, an increase of 7.1%. The increase was primarily driven by higher usage from
        the existing customers.                                                   
        The Nordics region was better prepared for the GDPR related requirements and there was limited GDPR related revenue
        offset in 2018 compared to Group’s other operating segments. In Central Europe, the revenue was NOK 639.5 million
        for the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to NOK 515.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, an increase
        of 24.1%. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Teracomm Group in Bulgaria and consolidation of
        acquired entities in 2018, see 11.3.2 "Operating and financial review - Key factors affecting the Group’s results of
        operations - Acquisitions".                                               
        In Western Europe, the revenue was NOK 956.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to NOK 242.5
        million for the year ended 31 December 2018, an increase of 74.7%. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition
        of Spot.it in Italy and consolidation of acquired entities in 2018, see Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions".
        In Global Messaging segment, the revenue was NOK 356.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to
        NOK 298.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, an increase of 31.9%. The growth was primarily driven by the
        growth of password verification services that the Group introduced in late 2018 and it increased the Global Messaging
        revenue growth in 2019.

        Cost of services rendered was NOK 2.2 billion for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared to NOK 1.4 billion for
        the year ended 31 December 2018, an increase of 53.0%. This increase was primarily due as a result of the acquisitions
        completed in 2019. In addition, this increase was driven by the organic increase in messaging volumes and price
        increases from operators (e.g., in Norway).

        million for the year ended 31 December 2018, an increase of 42.5%. This increase was primarily as a result of an
        increase in wages and salaries and related expenses in 2019, mainly related to annual salary increases and expansion
        in the number of employees due to the acquisitions, which grew from 401 employees in the year ended 31 December
        2018 to 494 employees in the year ended 31 December 2019. For an overview of the development in number of

        Other operating expenses were NOK 224.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared to NOK 208.7 million
        for the year ended 31 December 2018, an increase of 7.6%. This increase was primarily related to acquisitions related
        restructuring initiatives. Introduction of IFRS 16 accounting policy positively impacted the operating expenses related to
        lease agreements positively by NOK 13.1 million in 2019. For a discussion on the limitations on the comparability of
        these results, see Section 4.2.2 "Factors affecting comparability of results".
        11.8.5 Depreciation and amortisation                                      
        Depreciation and amortisation were NOK 247.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared to NOK 85.7
        million for the year ended 31 December 2018, an increase of 188.8%. This increase was primarily due to the amortisation
        and impairment effects of intangible assets recognised as part of the purchase price allocation in connection with the
        acquisition of Link Mobility Group AS in October 2018 for a total consideration of NOK 3.4 billion, the inclusion of IFRS
        16 accounting and to the write-off of the investment in Joyn, which was due to the commercial decision not to pursue
        the development of Joyn. For a discussion on the limitations on the comparability of these results, see Section 4.2.2
        "Factors affecting comparability of results".                             
        11.8.6 Total operating expenses                                           
        Total operating expenses were NOK 3.0 billion for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared to NOK 1.9 billion for
        the year ended 31 December 2018, an increase of 52.9%. This increase was primarily as a result of operating expenses
        related to the Netsize, TeraComm Group and Spot-hit acquisitions completed in 2019.

        Primarily as a result of the factors described above, the Group's operating loss for the year ended 31 December 2019
        was NOK 37.0 million, compared to a operating profit of NOK 29.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 with
        Gross Margin of 26% and 28% for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018. The lower Gross Margin is as a result
        of the changes in customer mix, with high volume customers, which pay a lower per message price, representing a
        higher percentage of the customer base. For the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, Gross Margin for the Nordics
        was 32% and 33%, respectively; for Central Europe was 26% and 26%, respectively; for Western Europe was 24%
        and 30%, respectively; and for Global Messaging was 11% and 13%, respectively.

        Finance income was NOK 22.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared to NOK 15.0 million for the year
        ended 31 December 2018, an increase of 46.6%. This increase was primarily as a result of increase in foreign exchange
        gains. The increase in other financial income was mainly due to the reversal of a credit from the year ended 31 December
        2018. For a discussion on the limitations on the comparability of these results, see Section 4.2.2 "Factors affecting
        comparability of results".

        year ended 31 December 2018, an increase of 44.5%. This increase was primarily related to increase on interest
        expenses, amortised costs and losses on foreign exchange primarily related to the Senior Facilities Agreements (see
        Section 4.2.2 "Factors affecting comparability of results"). Further and during the year ended 31 December 2018, Link
        Mobility Group AS incurred an expense of NOK 69,606 thousand related to early settlement of its bond loan, as well as
        an expense of NOK 20,732 thousand related to adjustments on the purchase price of previously acquired subsidiary.

        Total income tax was NOK 2.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared to NOK 23.4 million for the year
        ended 31 December 2018, a decrease of 109.3%. This decrease in income tax was mainly due to increase in deferred
        tax expense in 2018. For a discussion on the limitations on the comparability of these results, see Section 4.2.2 "Factors
        affecting comparability of results".

        Revenue was NOK 1,972.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 compared to NOK 1,294.0 million for the
        year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 52.4%. This increase was primarily as a result of organic
        growth and acquisitions during the year 2018. The organic growth was driven by the expansion of the Group’s
        customer base and stable revenue intake from the existing customers and the integration of the Global Messaging
        segment, which was acquired in 2018, to the Group’s operations. This growth is also partly as a result of the
        introduction of new products such as Link Conversations, Link Data Insight and RCS in 2018. The revenue growth in
        the year ended 30 December 2018 was partially offset by costs and lower volumes related to GDPR
        compliance and data protection related adjustments.                       
        For the year ended 31 December 2018, Like-for-Like Revenue was NOK 1.4 billion (equal to 72.3% of the revenue for

        acquisitions which contributed with NOK 380 million in increased cost of services. In addition, the increase was driven

        NOK 205.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 8.8%. This increase was primarily as a result
        of an increase in wages and salaries and related expenses in 2018, mainly due to the increase in the Group’s employees
        following the acquisitions completed in 2018, which grew from 355 employees in the year ended 31 December 2017 to
        401 employees in the year ended 31 December 2018.

        for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 99.2%. This increase was primarily related to acquisitions’
        operational and restructuring costs that increased due to the integration of the acquired businesses to the Group’s
        operations.

        Depreciation and amortisation was NOK 85.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, compared to NOK 41.7
        million for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 105.3%. This increase was primarily due to amortisation
        of intangible assets in 2018.

        the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 55.2%. This increase was primarily as a result of acquisitions of
        Horisen Messaging, Simple SMS, Archynet, SMS.it, Multiwizz and Dream Interactive completed in 2018.

        11.9.7 Operating profit (loss)                                            
        Primarily as a result of the factors described above, the Group's operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2018
        was NOK 29.8 million, compared to NOK 45.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2017, a decrease of 34.1%. This
        was primarily a result of the Group recording a Gross Margin of 28% and 31% for the years ended 31 December 2018
        and 2017. The lower Gross Margin is as a result of the changes in customer mix, with high volume customers, which
        pay a lower per message price, representing a higher percentage of the customer base. For the years ended 31 December
        2018 and 2017 Gross Margin for the Nordics was 33% and 36%, respectively; for Central Europe was 26% and 22%,
        respectively; for Western Europe was 30% and 20%, respectively; and for Global Messaging was 13% and not applicable
        (as it became an operating segment in 2018), respectively.                
        11.9.8 Finance income

        ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 73.9%. This increase was primarily as a result of increase in foreign exchange
        gains, partially offset by a decrease in other financial income mainly due to minor decreases in interest income from
        bank deposits.                                                            
        11.9.9 Finance expenses

        year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 172.2%. This increase was primarily as a result of an increase in premium
        early settlement and expensed transaction cost in connection with the early repayment of financing arrangements in
        connection with the Group’s acquisition by LINK Pecunia. These costs also took effect in 2019.
        11.9.10 Total finance income (expense)

        the Group’s net finance expense for the year ended 31 December 2018 was NOK 134.4 million, compared to an expense
        of NOK 46.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 190.5%.

        for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 643.5%. The increase in income tax was mainly due to the increase
        in deferred tax in 2018.                                                  
        11.9.12 Profit (loss)                                                     
        As a result of the factors described above, the Group’s loss for the year ended 31 December 2018 was NOK 81.3 million,

        11.10 Non-IFRS financial measures and other key performance indicators    
        In assessing the performance of the Group’s business, it considers a variety of financial and operating metrics, including
        certain financial measures which are not measures of financial performance under IFRS, as adopted by the European
        Union. Such measures may not be indicative of historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive
        of future results. The Group has presented these non-IFRS measures in this Prospectus because it considers them an
        important supplemental measure of its performance and believes that they are widely used by investors in comparing
        performance between companies.                                            
                                                                                  
                                        77

        However, not all companies may calculate the non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis
        and, as a result, the presentation thereof may not be comparable to measures used by other companies under the same
        or similar names. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the non-IFRS financial measures contained in this
        Prospectus and they should not be considered as a substitute for revenue, and EBIT or other financial measures
        computed in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union. For a description of non-IFRS measures discussed
        in this Section, see Section 4.2.3 "Non-IFRS financial measures".

            (a) Acquisition Revenue is defined as revenue generated by the acquired entities for the periods indicated. The Company considers Acquisition
                Revenue any revenue generated by acquired entities for four full consecutive quarters after complete ownership by the Company of such
                entity. From 1 January 2018 an acquired Spanish entity was merged with an existing entity, hence the allocation of revenues between organic
                and acquired revenue is based on a management estimate. In 2017 an acquired Danish entity was merged with an existing Danish entity,
                hence the allocation between organic and acquired revenue is estimated. See Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions".
            (b) When comparing the Like-for-Like Revenue for a relevant period, the entities used for such calculation differ from period to period, as the
                Company excludes revenues from companies acquired during the relevant periods in calculating Like-for-Like Revenue. This methodology
                allows the Company to isolate and compare the revenue generated by the companies that were operating for the full relevant period compared.
                See Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions".                                
                When comparing the years ended 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2019, the Company excludes revenues from companies acquired in
                2019 and 2018, but includes the revenue from companies acquired in 2017, as the Company no longer considers such revenue as Acquisition
                Revenue. The growth rate of Like-for-Like Revenue for the years ended 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2019 increased from 1,956.9 to
                2,128.7, an increase of 9%.                                       
                When comparing the years ended 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2018, the Company excludes revenues from companies acquired in
                2017 and 2018. The growth rate of Like-for-Like Revenue for the years ended 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2018 increased from
                1,255.4 to 1,387.9, an increase of 11%.                           
         6 Gross Profit Conversion is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Gross Profit.
         7 Revenue Net Retention Rate is defined as revenue from the net of upsale, downsale and churn for customers throughout the period, not taking into
           account new customers during the year. Revenue Net Retention Rate excludes the acquisitions of TeraComm Group and Spothit. Excluding Spain, these
           figures are 116% and 111% for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and as of 31 December 2020, respectively. The data required to calculate these
           measures was not yet monitored in the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 and as a result comparatives for the years ended 31 December 2017
           and 2018 are not available.                                            
         8 Churn Rate is defined as revenue of customers that were a customer in the prior period but were not a customer at the beginning of the current period
           divided by the total revenue of the prior period. The data required to calculate these measures was not yet monitored in the years ended 31 December
           2017 and 2018 and as a result comparatives for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 are not available.
         9 Net Customer Expansion Rate is defined as the revenue generated from customers at the end of the period with their corresponding revenue from the
           same period in the previous year.                                      
        11.11 Liquidity and capital resources                                     
              1Introduction                                                       
        The Group manages its financing structure and cash flow requirements in response to the Group’s strategy and
        objectives, deploying financial and other resources related to those objectives.
        As of the date of this Prospectus, the Group has available cash resources amounting to approximately NOK 515 million.
        The Group currently has undrawn credit facilities in an amount of NOK 9 million. The Group holds cash in in the following
        currencies: BGN, CHF, DKK, EUR, GBP, HUF, MKD, NOK, PLN, RON, SEK and USD.
        The Group’s liquidity requirements arise primarily from the need to fund working capital and capital expenditures for the
        expansion, maintenance and refurbishment of the Group’s information technology and other assets, as well as to make
        acquisitions and realise potential growth and cost-saving opportunities from acquisitions and related synergies.
        The Group's main source of liquidity are primarily through financing arrangements, revenues from operating activities
        and cash and cash equivalents.                                            
        The Group may also dispose of non-core businesses or enter into joint ventures or other partnerships that would generate
        cash. The Group’s future financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, many of which are not foreseeable.
        The Group assesses capital on the basis of a leverage ratio as shown in the table below on an as adjusted basis as of
        the date of the Prospectus (prior to Adjustments subject to the Offering and Listing). Please also refer to Section 9

        The Group is of the opinion that its available working capital is sufficient for the period covering at least twelve months
        from the date of the Prospectus (see Section 9.2 "Working capital statement").

         1 Represents the Six Months Condensed Interim Financial Statements.      
        Net cash inflow from operating activities                                 
        Net cash inflow from operating activities has increased by NOK 110.8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 to
        NOK 177.4 million from NOK 66.6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2019. The increase is primarily driven by
        the increase in EBITDA of NOK 76.7 million. EBITDA increased principally as a result of the organic and acquired growth
        in revenue which grew more than the operating expenses. Additionally the increase is driven by the net change in trade
        receivables, partially offset by trade payables and it is a result of the Group’s focus on working capital.
        Net financial items, comprised of finance income and finance expense, are NOK 294.5 million for the six months ended
        30 June 2020 compared to NOK 54.9 million for the corresponding period in 2019. The total interest expense element
        is comparable to the prior year and the increase is driven by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
        There is also a large comparative increase in the net change in trade and other receivables and a corresponding decrease
        in the change in trade and other payables; this is the result of the Group's increased focus on managing working capital
        during first half of 2020.

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        Net cash outflow from investing activities                                
        Net cash outflow from investing activities has decreased by NOK 229.8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020
        to negative NOK 49.8 million from negative NOK 279.6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2019. The decrease is
        due to the expenses related to the acquisition of Netsize in 2019; there are no comparative large acquisitions in the first
        half of 2020, as the Group did not complete any acquisitions in the six months ended 30 June 2020. See Section 11.3.2
        "Acquisitions". This is partially offset by a slight decrease in investment in intangible assets in 2020.
        Net cash inflow from financing activities                                 
        Net cash inflow from financing activities has increased by NOK 102.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 to
        NOK 329.3 million from NOK 227.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2019. The increase is due to increased loan
        facility drawdowns (NOK 137.3 million) which are partially offset by increased interest payments in 2020 of NOK 22.8
        million and increased repayments of borrowings of NOK 20.8 million.       
        Cash and cash equivalent                                                  
        Cash and cash equivalents have increased by NOK 398.6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 to NOK 577.5
        million from NOK 179.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2019. This increase is primarily due to increased loan
        facility drawdowns under the Senior Facilities Agreement, a decrease in expenses related to acquisitions in the six months
        ended 30 June 2020, as well as foreign exchange gains.

        Net cash flow from operating activities                                   
        Net cash flow from operating activities increased from an outflow of NOK 28.2 million in the year ended 31 December
        2018 an inflow of to NOK 225.5 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. The increase was mainly driven by the
        increase in EBITDA of NOK 95.4 million which was primarily driven by the organic and acquired growth in the year ended
        31 December 2019 compared to the year ended 31 December 2018, in addition to the termination of the share option
        scheme in 2018 in connection with the acquisition of Link Mobility Group AS by the Company which reduced the net cash
        flow from operations in the year ended 31 December 2018 with NOK 139.3 million.
        The decrease of cash inflow from operating activities to NOK 28.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 from
        NOK 120.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2017, is mainly driven by the cash effect of share-based employee
        benefits in 2018. As part of the take-over, the share option scheme was discontinued, and all options were vested. The
        share options were settled in cash, this was the total cash settlement.   
        Net cash flow from investing activities                                   
        Net cash outflow from investing activities increased from an outflow of NOK 328.4 million in the year ended 31 December
        2018 to an outflow of NOK 461.3 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. The increased outflow is principally a
        result of the acquisitions of Netsize, Teracomm Group, and Spot-Hit in 2019, additionally increased purchases of
        intangible assets as the company has been investing into its CPaaS platform.
        The increase of cash inflow from investing activities in the year ended 31 December 2018 to negative NOK 328.4 million
        from a negative net cash flow of 485.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2017. This change is also reflective of
        reduced acquisition activity in the period. In 2017, larger acquisitions (LINK Mobility Spain SLU, LINK Mobility EAD, LINK
        Mobility Sp.z.o.o. and LINK Mobility SAS) are included as compared to 2018 where there are smaller acquisitions (Horisen
        Messaging AG, Simple SMS Group, Archynet s.r.s., SMS IT Srl and Multiwizz SAS, Hay Systems Ltd, and Dream
        Interactive Ltd).                                                         
        Net cash inflow from financing activities                                 
        Net cash inflow from financing activities has increased since the year ended 31 December 2018, from a net cash flow of
        NOK 122.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to NOK 215.1 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. The
        increase is driven by draws on loan facilities in 2019 and is offset by increased interest payments in the comparative
        period as there is more outstanding debt.                                 
        The decrease of cash inflow from financing activities in the year ended 31 December 2018 to NOK 122.6 million from
        NOK 500.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2017, was mainly driven by the repayment of a bond loan and hold-
        back in 2017; there is no such comparative in 2018.                       
        Cash and cash equivalents                                                 
        Cash and cash equivalents have decreased since the year ended 31 December 2018 from NOK 161.9 million, to
        NOK 147.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2019, mainly due to the changes described above.
        The decrease in cash and cash equivalent in the year ended 31 December 2018 to NOK 161.9 million from NOK 342.7
        million in the year ended 31 December 2017, was mainly driven by the servicing of loans.

        12.6  Management incentive program                                        
        12.6.1 Introduction                                                       
        Prior to the Listing, the Company has had in place a cash based management incentive program. In connection with the
        Listing, the old management incentive program will be cancelled and replaced by the RSUs and the LTI program as
        described below.                                                          
        12.6.2 RSU                                                                
        The Board has approved a program to grant RSUs in the form of share options to member of management as replacement
        for the accrued value under the cancelled management incentive program. The RSUs will be exercisable into ordinary
        shares as follows; (i) 40% upon the first anniversary of the Listing, (ii) 30% upon the second anniversary of the Listing,
        and (iii) 30% upon the third anniversary of the Listing. Exercise of the RSUs are subject to the RSU holder being
        employed with the Group at the time of exercise. Other than the nominal value of the ordinary shares, no payment is
        required by the RSU holder upon exercise. The total number of RSUs and the actual grant of RSUs will be resolved by
                                        90                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        the Board in connection with the Listing, and is expected to amount to approximately 1% of the fully diluted share capital
        of the Company upon Listing.                                              
                                                                                  
        12.6.3 Long-term incentive program (LTI)                                  
        The Board has resolved to implement a long-term incentive program (LTI) for its management and key employees,
        including the members of management as set out in the table above. The LTI program is capped at 10,000,000 share
        options that can be granted by the Board with 20% of the program annually over a five year period, the first possible
        grant to take place in connection with the Listing. Each share option will give the option holder the right to subscribe
        and be allocated one ordinary share in the Company at the strike price. Grant and allocation of share options are at the
        discretion of the Board, taking into consideration achievement of budget as approved by the Board or certain
        performance based indicators based on the budget. The strike price for the share options will be based on the market
        value of the Shares on the date of the grant. The share options has a one-year vesting period from the grant date and
        can thereafter be exercise during a seven year period. Exercise of vested share options are subject to the option holder
        being employed with the Group at the time of exercised. Share options that are not exercised within the exercise period
        will laps and be of no value to the option holder.                        
        The Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to settle any share options by transfer of existing shares, new shares
        or a mix of the two. Further, the Company has the right to settle any vested share option in cash in the event of certain
        circumstances, such as in the event of a public take-over.                
        The Board intends to grant the first 2,000,000 share options in connection with the Listing. The strike price for these
        share options will be equal to the Offer Price.                           
        12.6.4 Participation of the employees in the Company’s share capital      
        In 2019, the Group completed an employee share purchase program in which the Group’s employees were invited to
        participate in the share capital of the Company. The employee share purchase program was structured so that the
        employees became indirect owners in the Company by purchasing shares in a newly established Norwegian employee
        pooling company named LINK ESOT AS ("LINK ESOT"). As of the time of this Prospectus, Victory Partners VIII Limited
        controls LINK ESOT by holding one A-share. The remaining 16,200 shares are non-voting B shares held by the
        participating employees. LINK ESOT owns 324,000 Shares, each with a nominal value of NOK 0.005. The Shares were
        subscribed for a price per share of NOK 11.25 (the number of Shares, subscription price in the Company and purchase
        price for the LINK ESOT share represented 16,200 Shares in the Company, a subscription price of NOK 225 per Share
        and a purchase price of NOK 225 per LINK ESOT share prior to the 1:20 share split resolved by the Company on
        15 September 2020, see Section 13.3 "Share capital and share capital history".
        As a result of the Listing, the Company will consider a distribution of the Shares held by LINK ESOT (other than the
        Shares sold by Link ESOT in the Offering), resulting in the employees now owning Shares indirectly through the employee
        pooling company LINK ESOT will be owning Shares directly in the Company.  
        12.7  Benefits upon termination                                           
        The CEO and CTO have agreements with a 6 months' notice period in case of termination, during which they receive full
        compensation. The CFO has an agreement with a 6 months' notice period in case of termination, during which the CFO
        will receive full compensation and a 6 months' severance pay following the expiry of the notice period.
        Except for the above, no employee, including any member of Management, has entered into employment agreements
        that provide for any special benefits upon termination. None of the members of the Board of Directors, not being
        employees of the Group, have service contracts and none will be entitled to any benefits upon termination of office.

        Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries directly or indirectly holds any Shares at the date of this Prospectus.

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus

        13.7  Other financial instruments                                         
        Other than the options and RSUs described in Section 12.6 "Management incentive program", neither the Company nor
        any of its subsidiaries has issued any options, warrants, convertible loans or other instruments that would entitle a
        holder of any such instrument to subscribe for any shares in the Company or its subsidiaries. Furthermore, neither the
        Company nor any of its subsidiaries has issued subordinated debt or transferable securities other than the Shares and
        the shares in its subsidiaries that will be held, directly or indirectly, by the Company.
        13.8  Shareholder rights                                                  
        At the date of this Prospectus, the Company has one class of shares in issue, an in accordance with the Norwegian Public

        capital and share capital history" for information on the redemption of preferred shares on 24 September 2020.

        13.9.1 The Articles of Association                                        
        LINK Mobility's Articles of Association are set out in Appendix A to this Prospectus.
        Below is a summary of provisions of the Articles of Association.          
        Objective of the Company

        Registered office                                                         
        The Company’s registered office is in the municipality of Oslo, Norway.   
                                                                                  
        Share capital and nominal value                                           
        The Company’s share capital is NOK 1,070,993.70 divided into 214,198,740 Shares with each Share having a nominal

        Restrictions on transfer of Shares                                        
        The Articles of Association do not provide for any restrictions on the transfer of Shares, or a right of first refusal for the
        Company. Share transfers are not subject to approval by the Board of Directors.
        General meetings                                                          
        Documents relating to matters to be dealt with by the Company’s general meeting, including documents which by law
        shall be included in or attached to the notice of the general meeting, do not need to be sent to the shareholders if such
        documents have been made available on the Company’s internet site. A shareholder may nevertheless request that
        documents that relate to matters to be dealt with at the general meeting be sent to him/her.
        Nomination committee                                                      
        The Company shall have a nomination committee. See Section 12.10 "Nomination committee".
        13.9.2 Certain aspects of Norwegian corporate law                         
        General meetings                                                          
        Through the general meeting, shareholders exercise supreme authority in a Norwegian company. In accordance with
        Norwegian law, the annual general meeting of shareholders is required to be held each year on or prior to 30 June.
        Norwegian law requires that written notice of annual general meetings setting forth the time of, the venue for and the
        agenda of the meeting is sent to all shareholders with a known address no later than 21 days before the annual general
        meeting of Norwegian public limited liability company listed on stock exchange or regulated market shall be held, unless
        the articles of association stipulate a longer deadline, which is not currently the case for the Company.
        A shareholder may vote at the general meeting either in person or by proxy appointed at their own discretion. Although
        Norwegian law does not require the Company to send proxy forms to its shareholders for general meetings, the Company
        plans to include a proxy form with notices of general meetings. All of the Company’s shareholders who are registered in
        the register of shareholders maintained with the VPS as of the date of the general meeting, or who have otherwise
        reported and documented ownership to Shares, are entitled to participate at general meetings, without any requirement
        of pre-registration. The Company’s Articles of Association do however include a provision requiring shareholders to
        preregister in order to participate at general meetings.                  
        Apart from the annual general meeting, extraordinary general meetings of shareholders may be held if the Board of
        Directors considers it necessary. An extraordinary general meeting of shareholders must also be convened if, in order
        to discuss a specified matter, the auditor who audits the company’s annual accounts or shareholders representing at
        least 5% of the share capital demands this in writing. The requirements for notice and admission to the annual general
        meeting also apply to extraordinary general meetings. However, the annual general meeting of a Norwegian public
        limited liability company may with a majority of at least two-thirds of the aggregate number of votes cast as well as of
        least two-thirds of the share capital represented at a general meeting resolve that extraordinary general meetings may
                                        97                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        be convened with a fourteen days notice period until the next annual general meeting provided the company has
        procedures in place allowing shareholders to vote electronically. The Company’s Articles of Association does not permit
        electronic voting and extraordinary general meetings may accordingly not be convened with a fourteen days notice
        period, provided that the Company has established procedures for voting electronically at such meetings.
        Voting rights–amendments to the Articles of Association                   
        Under the Articles of Association, each Share carries one vote. No voting rights can be exercised with respect to any
        treasury Shares held by the Company.                                      
        In general, decisions that shareholders are entitled to make under Norwegian law or the Company’s Articles of
        Association may be made by a simple majority of the votes cast. In the case of elections or appointments, the person(s)
        who receive(s) the greatest number of votes cast are elected. However, as required under Norwegian law, certain
        decisions, including resolutions to waive preferential rights to subscribe in connection with any share issue in the
        Company, to approve a merger or demerger of the Company, to amend Articles of Association, to authorise an increase
        or reduction in the share capital, to authorise an issuance of convertible loans or warrants by the Company or to authorise
        the Board of Directors to purchase the Shares and hold them as treasury shares or to dissolve the Company, must
        receive the approval of at least two-thirds of the aggregate number of votes cast as well as at least two-thirds of the
        share capital represented at a general meeting. Norwegian law further requires that certain decisions, which have the
        effect of substantially altering the rights and preferences of any shares or class of shares, receive the approval by the
        holders of such shares or class of shares as well as the majority required for amending the Articles of Association.
        Decisions that (i) would reduce the rights of some or all of the Company’s shareholders in respect of dividend payments
        or other rights to assets or (ii) restrict the transferability of the shares, require that at least 90% of the share capital
        represented at the general meeting in question vote in favour of the resolution, as well as the majority required for
        amending the Articles of Association. Certain types of changes in the rights of shareholders require the consent of all
        shareholders affected thereby as well as the majority required for amending the Articles of Association.
        In general, only a shareholder registered in the VPS is entitled to vote for such shares. Beneficial owners of shares that
        are registered in the name of a nominee are generally not entitled to vote under Norwegian law, nor is any person who
        is designated in the VPS register as the holder of such shares as nominees. Investors should note that there are varying
        opinions as to the interpretation of the right to vote on nominee registered shares. In the Company’s view, a nominee
        may not meet or vote for shares registered on a nominee account (NOM-account). A shareholder must, in order to be
        eligible to register, meet and vote for such shares at the general meeting, transfer the shares from such NOM-account
        to an account in the shareholder’s name. Such registration must appear from a transcript from the VPS at the latest at
        the date of the general meeting.                                          
        There are no quorum requirements that apply to the general meetings.      
        Additional issuances and preferential rights                              
        If the Company issues any new shares, including bonus share issues, the Company’s Articles of Association must be
        amended, which requires the same vote as other amendments to its Articles of Association. In addition, under Norwegian
        law, the Company’s shareholders have a preferential right to subscribe for new Shares issued by the Company.
        Preferential rights may be derogated from by resolution in a general meeting passed by the same vote required to
        approve amending the Articles of Association. A derogation of the shareholders’ preferential rights in respect of bonus
        issues requires the approval of all outstanding shares.                   
        The general meeting may, by the same vote as is required for amending the Articles of Association, authorise the Board
        of Directors to issue new shares, and to derogate from the preferential rights of shareholders in connection with such
        issuances. Such authorisation may be effective for a maximum of two years, and the nominal value of the shares to be
        issued may not exceed 50% of the registered nominal share capital when the authorisation is registered with the
        Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises.                               
        Under Norwegian law, the Company may increase its share capital by a bonus share issue, subject to approval by the
        Company’s shareholders, by transfer from the Company’s distributable equity or from the Company’s share premium
        reserve and thus the share capital increase does not require any payment of a subscription price by the shareholders.
        Any bonus issues may be affected either by issuing new shares to the Company’s existing shareholders or by increasing
        the nominal value of the Company’s outstanding shares.                    
        Issuance of new shares to shareholders who are citizens or residents of the United States upon the exercise of
        preferential rights may require the Company to file a registration statement in the United States under United States
        securities laws. Should the Company in such a situation decide not to file a registration statement, the Company’s U.S.
        shareholders may not be able to exercise their preferential rights. If a U.S. shareholder is ineligible to participate in a
        rights offering, such shareholder would not receive the rights at all and the rights would be sold on the shareholder’s
        behalf by the Company. Shareholders in other jurisdictions outside Norway may be similarly affected if the rights and
        the new shares being offered have not been registered with, or approved by, the relevant authorities in such jurisdiction.
        To the extent that the Company’s shareholders are not able to exercise their rights to subscribe for new shares, their
        proportional interests in the Company will be reduced.                    
        Minority rights                                                           
        Norwegian law sets forth a number of protections for minority shareholders of the Company, including but not limited to
        those described in this paragraph and the description of general meetings as set out above. Any of the Company’s
        shareholders may petition Norwegian courts to have a decision of the Board of Directors or the Company’s shareholders
        made at the general meeting declared invalid on the grounds that it unreasonably favours certain shareholders or third
        parties to the detriment of other shareholders or the Company itself. The Company’s shareholders may also petition the

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        courts to dissolve the Company as a result of such decisions to the extent particularly strong reasons are considered by
        the court to make necessary dissolution of the Company.                   
                                                                                  
        Minority shareholders holding 5% or more of the Company’s share capital have a right to demand in writing that the
        Company’s Board of Directors convene an extraordinary general meeting to discuss or resolve specific matters. In
        addition, any of the Company’s shareholders may in writing demand that the Company place an item on the agenda for
        any general meeting as long as the Company is notified in time for such item to be included in the notice of the meeting.
        If the notice has been issued when such a written demand is presented, a renewed notice must be issued if the deadline
        for issuing notice of the general meeting has not expired.                
        Rights of redemption and repurchase of Shares                             
        The share capital of the Company may be reduced by reducing the nominal value of the Shares or by cancelling Shares.
        Such a decision requires the approval of at least two-thirds of the aggregate number of votes cast and at least two thirds
        of the share capital represented at a general meeting. Redemption of individual Shares requires the consent of the
        holders of the Shares to be redeemed.                                     
        The Company may purchase its own Shares provided that the Board of Directors has been granted an authorisation to
        do so by a general meeting with the approval of at least two-thirds of the aggregate number of votes cast and at least
        two-thirds of the share capital represented at the meeting. The aggregate nominal value of treasury shares so acquired,
        and held by the Company must not exceed 10% of the Company’s share capital, and treasury shares may only be
        acquired if the Company’s distributable equity, according to the latest adopted balance sheet or an interim balance
        sheet, exceeds the consideration to be paid for the shares. The authorisation by the General Meeting of the Company’s
        shareholders cannot be granted for a period exceeding two years.          
        Shareholder vote on certain reorganisations                               
        A decision of the Company’s shareholders to merge with another company or to demerge requires a resolution by the
        general meeting of the shareholders passed by at least two-thirds of the aggregate votes cast and at least two-thirds of
        the share capital represented at the general meeting. A merger plan, or demerger plan signed by the Board of Directors
        along with certain other required documentation, would have to be sent to all the Company’s shareholders, or if the
        Articles of Association stipulate that, made available to the shareholders on the company’s website, at least one month
        prior to the general meeting to pass upon the matter.                     
        Liability of members of the Board of Directors                            
        Members of the Board of Directors owe a fiduciary duty to the Company and its shareholders. Such fiduciary duty requires
        that the Board members act in the best interests of the Company when exercising their functions and exercise a general
        duty of loyalty and care towards the Company. Their principal task is to safeguard the interests of the Company.
        Members of the Board of Directors may each be held liable for any damage they negligently or wilfully cause the
        Company. Norwegian law permits the general meeting to discharge any such person from liability, but such discharge is
        not binding on the Company if substantially correct and complete information was not provided at the general meeting
        of the Company’s shareholders passing upon the matter. If a resolution to discharge the Company’s directors from
        liability or not to pursue claims against such a person has been passed by a general meeting with a smaller majority
        than that required to amend the Company’s Articles of Association, shareholders representing more than 10% of the
        share capital or, if there are more than 100 shareholders, more than 10% of the shareholders may pursue the claim on
        the Company’s behalf and in its name. The cost of any such action is not the Company’s responsibility but can be
        recovered from any proceeds the Company receives as a result of the action. If the decision to discharge any of the
        Company’s directors from liability or not to pursue claims against the Company’s directors is made by such a majority
        as is necessary to amend the Articles of Association, the minority shareholders of the Company cannot pursue such
        claim in the Company’s name.                                              
        Indemnification of Directors                                              
        Neither Norwegian law nor the Articles of Association contains any provision concerning indemnification by the Company
        of the Board of Directors. The Company is permitted to purchase insurance for the Company’s directors against certain
        liabilities that they may incur in their capacity as such.                
        Distribution of assets on liquidation                                     
        Under Norwegian law, the Company may be wound-up by a resolution of the Company’s shareholders at the general
        meeting passed by at least two-thirds of the aggregate votes cast and at least two-thirds of the share capital represented
        at the meeting. For further information on how the shares rank in the event of liquidation, reference is made to Section
        13.8.                                                                     
        13.9.3 Shareholder agreements                                             
        There is a shareholder agreement between the Selling Shareholders which will be terminated upon completion of the
        Offering.

        15    SECURITIES TRADING IN NORWAY                                        
        Set out below is a summary of certain aspects of securities trading in Norway. The summary is based on the rules and
        regulations in force in Norway as of the date of this Prospectus, which may be subject to changes occurring after such
        date. This summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of securities trading in Norway. Investors who
        wish to clarify aspects of securities trading in Norway should consult with and rely upon their own advisors.
        15.1  Introduction                                                        
        The Oslo Stock Exchange was established in 1819 and is the principal market in which shares, bonds and other financial
        instruments are traded in Norway through five different marketplaces; the Oslo Stock Exchange, Oslo Axess, Merkur
        Market, Nordic ABM and Oslo Connect.                                      
        The Oslo Stock Exchange is 100% owned by Oslo Børs VPS Holding ASA, which in 2019 was acquired by Euronext N.V.,
        a pan-European stock exchange with its registered office in Amsterdam and corporate headquarters at La Défense in
        Greater Paris which operates markets in Amsterdam, Brussels, London, Lisbon, Dublin, Oslo and Paris.
        15.2  Trading and settlement                                              
        As of the date of this Prospectus, trading of equities on the Oslo Stock Exchange is carried out in the electronic trading
        system Millennium Exchange7. This trading system is in use by all markets operated by the London Stock Exchange as
        well as by the Borsa Italiana and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.        
        Official trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange takes place between 9:00 hours. (CET/CEST) and 16.20 hours (CET/CEST)
        each trading day, with pre-trade period between 08:15 hours (CET/CEST) and 9:00 hours (CET/CEST), a closing auction
        from 16.20 hours (CET/CEST) to 16.25 hours (CET/CEST), and a post-trade period from 16.25 hours (CET/CEST) to
        17.30 hours (CET/CEST).                                                   
        The settlement period for trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange is two trading days (T+2). This means that securities will
        be settled on the investor’s account in the VPS two trading days after the transaction, and that the seller will receive
        payment after two trading days.                                           
        Investment services in Norway may only be provided by Norwegian investment firms holding a license under the
        Norwegian Securities Trading Act, branches of investment firms from a member state of the EEA or investment firms
        from outside the EEA that have been licensed to operate in Norway. Investment firms in an EEA member state may also
        provide cross-border investment services into Norway.                     
        It is possible for investment firms to undertake market-making activities in shares listed in Norway if they have a license
        to this effect under the Norwegian Securities Trading Act, or in the case of investment firms in an EEA member state, a
        license to carry out market-making activities in their home jurisdiction. Such market-making activities will be governed
        by the regulations of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act relating to brokers' trading for their own account. However,
        such market-making activities do not as such require notification to the Norwegian FSA or the Oslo Stock Exchange
        except for the general obligation of investment firms that are members of the Oslo Stock Exchange to report all trades
        in stock exchange listed securities.                                      
        15.3  Information, control and surveillance                               
        Under Norwegian law, the Oslo Stock Exchange is required to perform a number of surveillance and control functions.
        The Surveillance and Corporate Control unit of the Oslo Stock Exchange monitors all market activity on a continuous
        basis. Market surveillance systems are largely automated, promptly warning department personnel of abnormal market
        developments.                                                             
        The Norwegian FSA controls the issuance of securities in both the equity and bond markets in Norway and evaluates
        whether the issuance documentation contains the required information and whether it would otherwise be unlawful to
        carry out the issuance.                                                   
        Under Norwegian law, a company that is listed on a Norwegian regulated market, or is subject to the application for
        listing on such market, must promptly release any inside information directly concerning the company (i.e. precise
        information about financial instruments, the issuer thereof or other matters that are likely to have a significant effect on
        the price of the relevant financial instruments or related financial instruments, and that are not publicly available or
        commonly known in the market). A company may, however, delay the release of such information in order not to
        prejudice its legitimate interests, provided that it is able to ensure the confidentiality of the information and that the
        delayed release would not be likely to mislead the public. The Oslo Stock Exchange may levy fines on companies violating
        these requirements.                                                       
        15.4  The VPS and transfer of shares                                      
        The Company's shareholder register is operated through the VPS. The VPS is the Norwegian paperless centralised
        securities register. It is a computerised bookkeeping system in which the ownership of, and all transactions relating to,
        Norwegian listed shares must be recorded. The VPS and the Oslo Stock Exchange are both wholly owned by Euronext
        Nordics Holding AS.                                                       
        All transactions relating to securities registered with the VPS are made through computerised book entries. No physical
        share certificates are, or may be, issued. The VPS confirms each entry by sending a transcript to the registered
        shareholder irrespective of any beneficial ownership. To give effect to such entries, the individual shareholder must
        7 Following Euronext's acquisition of Oslo Børs VPS Holding ASA in June 2019, the Oslo Stock Exchange trading systems, across asset
        classes, will migrate from the Millennium Exchange and SOLA systems to the Euronext Optiq® systems.The migration is scheduled for
        the third quarter and the fourth quarter 2020 pending regulatory approval.

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        establish a share account with a Norwegian account agent. Norwegian banks, Norges Bank (Norway's central bank),
        authorised securities brokers in Norway and Norwegian branches of credit institutions established within the EEA are
        allowed to act as account agents.                                         
        The entry of a transaction in the VPS is prima facie evidence in determining the legal rights of parties as against the
        issuing company or any third party claiming an interest in the given security. A transferee or assignee of shares may
        not exercise the rights of a shareholder with respect to such shares unless such transferee or assignee has registered
        such shareholding or has reported and shown evidence of such share acquisition, and the acquisition is not prevented
        by law, the relevant company's articles of association or otherwise.      
        The VPS is liable for any loss suffered as a result of faulty registration or an amendment to, or deletion of, rights in
        respect of registered securities unless the error is caused by matters outside the VPS's control that the VPS could not
        reasonably be expected to avoid or overcome the consequences of. Damages payable by the VPS may, however, be
        reduced in the event of contributory negligence by the aggrieved party.   
        The VPS must provide information to the Norwegian FSA on an on-going basis, as well as any information that the
        Norwegian FSA requests. Further, Norwegian tax authorities may require certain information from the VPS regarding
        any individual's holdings of securities, including information about dividends and interest payments.
        15.5  Shareholder register                                                
        Under Norwegian law, shares are registered in the name of the beneficial owner of the shares. As a general rule, there
        are no arrangements for nominee registration, and Norwegian shareholders are not allowed to register their shares in
        the VPS through a nominee. However, foreign shareholders may register their shares in the VPS in the name of a
        nominee (bank or other nominee) approved by the Norwegian FSA. An approved and registered nominee has a duty to
        provide information on demand about beneficial shareholders to the Company and to the Norwegian authorities. In case
        of registration by nominees, the registration in the VPS must show that the registered owner is a nominee. A registered
        nominee has the right to receive dividends and other distributions but cannot vote in General Meetings on behalf of the
        beneficial owners.                                                        
        15.6  Foreign investment in shares listed in Norway                       
        Foreign investors may trade shares listed on the Oslo Axess through any broker that is a member of the Oslo Stock
        Exchange, whether Norwegian or foreign.                                   
        15.7  Disclosure obligations                                              
        If a person's, entity's or consolidated group's proportion of the total issued shares and/or rights to shares in a company
        listed on a regulated market in Norway (with Norway as its home state, which will be the case for the Company) reaches,
        exceeds or falls below the respective thresholds of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 1/3, 50%, 2/3 or 90% of the share
        capital or the voting rights of that company, the person, entity or group in question has an obligation under the
        Norwegian Securities Trading Act to notify the Oslo Stock Exchange and the issuer immediately. The same applies if the
        disclosure thresholds are passed due to other circumstances, such as a change in the company's share capital.
        15.8  Insider trading                                                     
        According to Norwegian law, subscription for, purchase, sale or exchange of financial instruments that are listed, or
        subject to the application for listing, on a Norwegian regulated market, or incitement to such dispositions, must not be
        undertaken by anyone who has inside information, as defined in Section 3-2 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.
        The same applies to the entry into, purchase, sale or exchange of options or futures/forward contracts or equivalent
        rights whose value is connected to such financial instruments or incitement to such dispositions.
        15.9  Mandatory offer requirement                                         
        The Norwegian Securities Trading Act requires any person, entity or consolidated group that becomes the owner of
        shares representing more than one-third (or more than 40% or 50%) of the voting rights of a company listed on a
        Norwegian regulated market (with the exception of certain foreign companies) to, within four weeks, make an
        unconditional general offer for the purchase of the remaining shares in that company. A mandatory offer obligation may
        also be triggered where a party acquires the right to become the owner of shares that, together with the party's own
        shareholding, represent more than one-third of the voting rights in the company and the Oslo Stock Exchange decides
        that this is regarded as an effective acquisition of the shares in question.
        The mandatory offer obligation ceases to apply if the person, entity or consolidated group sells the portion of the shares
        that exceeds the relevant threshold within four weeks of the date on which the mandatory offer obligation was triggered.
        When a mandatory offer obligation is triggered, the person subject to the obligation is required to immediately notify
        the Oslo Stock Exchange and the company in question accordingly. The notification is required to state whether an offer
        will be made to acquire the remaining shares in the company or whether a sale will take place. As a rule, a notification
        to the effect that an offer will be made cannot be retracted. The offer and the offer document required are subject to
        approval by the Oslo Stock Exchange, in its capacity as Take-over Authority of Norway, before the offer is submitted to
        the shareholders or made public.                                          
        The offer price per share must be at least as high as the highest price paid or agreed to be paid by the offer for the
        shares in the six months period prior to the date the threshold was exceeded. However, if it is clear that that the market
        price was higher when the mandatory offer obligation was triggered, the offer price shall be at least as high as the
        market price. If the acquirer acquires or agrees to acquire additional shares at a higher price prior to the expiration of
        the mandatory offer period, the acquirer is obliged to restate its offer at such higher price. A mandatory offer must be
        in cash or contain a cash alternative at least equivalent to any other consideration offered.
                                        102                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        In case of failure to make a mandatory offer or to sell the portion of the shares that exceeds the relevant mandatory
        offer threshold within four weeks, the Oslo Stock Exchange may force the acquirer to sell the shares exceeding the
        threshold by public auction. Moreover, a shareholder who fails to make an offer may not, as long as the mandatory offer
        obligation remains in force, exercise rights in the company, such as voting in a general meeting of the company's
        shareholders, without the consent of a majority of the remaining shareholders. The shareholder may, however, exercise
        his/her/its rights to dividends and pre-emption rights in the event of a share capital increase. If the shareholder neglects
        his/her/its duty to make a mandatory offer, the Oslo Stock Exchange may impose a cumulative daily fine that accrues
        until the circumstance has been rectified.                                
        Any person, entity or consolidated group that owns shares representing more than one-third of the votes in a company
        listed on a Norwegian regulated market (with the exception of certain foreign companies) is obliged to make an offer to
        purchase the remaining shares of the company (repeated offer obligation) if the person, entity or consolidated group
        through acquisition becomes the owner of shares representing 40%, or more of the votes in the company. The same
        applies correspondingly if the person, entity or consolidated group through acquisition becomes the owner of shares
        representing 50% or more of the votes in the company. The mandatory offer obligation ceases to apply if the person,
        entity or consolidated group sells the portion of the shares which exceeds the relevant threshold within four weeks of
        the date on which the mandatory offer obligation was triggered.           
        Any person, entity or consolidated group that has passed any of the above mentioned thresholds in such a way as not
        to trigger the mandatory bid obligation, and has therefore not previously made an offer for the remaining shares in the
        company in accordance with the mandatory offer rules is, as a main rule, obliged to make a mandatory offer in the event
        of a subsequent acquisition of shares in the company.                     
        15.10 Compulsory acquisition                                              
        Pursuant to the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act and the Norwegian Securities Trading Act, a
        shareholder who, directly or through subsidiaries, acquires shares representing 90% or more of the total number of
        issued shares in a Norwegian public limited liability company, as well as 90% or more of the total voting rights, has a
        right, and each remaining minority shareholder of the company has a right to require such majority shareholder, to
        effect a compulsory acquisition for cash of the shares not already owned by such majority shareholder. Through such
        compulsory acquisition, the majority shareholder becomes the owner of the remaining shares with immediate effect.
        If a shareholder acquires shares representing more than 90% of the total number of issued shares, as well as 90% or
        more of the total voting rights, through a voluntary offer in accordance with the Norwegian Securities Trading Act, a
        compulsory acquisition can, subject to the following conditions, be carried out without such shareholder being obliged
        to make a mandatory offer: (i) the compulsory acquisition is commenced no later than four weeks after the acquisition
        of shares through the voluntary offer, (ii) the price offered per share is equal to or higher than the offer price would
        have been in a mandatory offer, and (iii) the settlement is guaranteed by a financial institution authorised to provide
        such guarantees in Norway.                                                
        A majority shareholder who effects a compulsory acquisition is required to offer the minority shareholders a specific
        price per share, the determination of which is at the discretion of the majority shareholder. However, where the offer,
        after making a mandatory or voluntary offer, has acquired more than 90% of the voting shares of a company and a
        corresponding proportion of the votes that can be cast at the general meeting, and the offer pursuant to Section 4-25
        of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act completes a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares within three
        months after the expiry of the offer period, it follows from the Norwegian Securities Trading Act that the redemption
        price shall be determined on the basis of the offer price for the mandatory/voluntary offer unless specific reasons indicate
        another price.                                                            
        Should any minority shareholder not accept the offered price, such minority shareholder may, within a specified deadline
        of not less than two months, request that the price be set by a Norwegian court. The cost of such court procedure will,
        as a general rule, be the responsibility of the majority shareholder, and the relevant court will have full discretion in
        determining the consideration to be paid to the minority shareholder as a result of the compulsory acquisition.
        Absent a request for a Norwegian court to set the price, or any other objection to the price being offered in a compulsory
        acquisition, the minority shareholders would be deemed to have accepted the offered price after the expiry of the
        specified deadline for raising objections to the price offered in the compulsory acquisition.
        15.11 Foreign exchange controls                                           
        There are currently no foreign exchange control restrictions in Norway that would potentially restrict the payment of
        dividends to a shareholder outside Norway, and there are currently no restrictions that would affect the right of
        shareholders of a company that has its shares registered with the VPS who are not residents in Norway to dispose of
        their shares and receive the proceeds from a disposal outside Norway. There is no maximum transferable amount either
        to or from Norway, although transferring banks are required to submit reports on foreign currency exchange transactions
        into and out of Norway into a central data register maintained by the Norwegian customs and excise authorities. The
        Norwegian police, tax authorities, customs and excise authorities, the National Insurance Administration and the
        Norwegian FSA have electronic access to the data in this register.        
                                        103

        16    TAXATION                                                            
        16.1  Certain Norwegian tax considerations                                
        16.1.1 General                                                            
        Set out in this chapter 16.1 is a summary of certain Norwegian tax matters related to an investment in the Company.
        The summary regarding Norwegian taxation is based on the laws in force in Norway as of the date of this Prospectus,
        which may be subject to any changes in law occurring after such date. Such changes could possibly be made on a
        retrospective basis.                                                      
        The following summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be
        relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the shares in the Company. Shareholders who wish to clarify their
        own tax situation should consult with and rely upon their own tax advisers. Shareholders resident in jurisdictions other
        than Norway and shareholders who cease to be resident in Norway for tax purposes (due to domestic tax law or tax
        treaty) should specifically consult with and rely upon their own tax advisers with respect to the tax position in their
        country of residence and the tax consequences related to ceasing to be resident in Norway for tax purposes. The
        statements in the summary only apply to shareholders who are beneficial owners of the Shares.
        Please note that for the purpose of the summary below, a reference to a Norwegian or non-Norwegian shareholder refers
        to the tax residency rather than the nationality of the shareholder.      
        The tax legislation in the Company's jurisdiction of incorporation and the tax legislation in the jurisdiction in which the
        shareholders are resident for tax purposes may have an impact on the income received from the Shares.
        16.1.2 Taxation of dividends                                              
        16.1.2.1 Norwegian Personal Shareholders                                  
        Dividends distributed to shareholders who are individuals resident in Norway for tax purposes ("Norwegian Personal
        Shareholders") are taxable as ordinary income in Norway, adjusted with a factor of 1.44. Ordinary income is taxed at
        a rate of 22%, giving an effective rate of 31.68 (22%x1.44). However, this will only apply to dividends exceeding a
        calculated risk-free return on the investment (tax free allowance), which itself is tax exempt.
        The tax free allowance is calculated annually on a share-by-share basis and pertains to the owner of the share at the
        expiration of the relevant calendar year. The tax-free allowance for each share is equal to the cost price of the share
        multiplied by a determined risk-free interest rate based on the effective rate after tax of interest on treasury bills (Nw.:
        statskasseveksler) with three months maturity, with an addition of 0.5%.  
        Norwegian Personal Shareholders who transfer shares will thus not be entitled to deduct any calculated tax free allowance
        related to the year of transfer.                                          
        Any part of the calculated allowance one year exceeding the dividend distributed on the share ("excess allowance") may
        be carried forward and set off against future dividends received on, or gains upon realisation, of the same share, and
        will be added to the basis for the allowance calculation. Allowance cannot result in a deductible loss.
        Norwegian Personal Shareholders may hold their shares through a share savings account (Nw.: aksjesparekonto).
        Dividends received on shares held through a share saving account will not be taxed with immediate effect. Instead,
        withdrawal of funds from the share saving account exceeding the paid in deposit will be regarded as taxable income,
        regardless of whether the funds are derived from gains or dividends related to the shares held in the account. Such
        income will be taxed with an effective tax rate of 31.68%, cf. above. The rules for tax free allowance also apply to share
        savings accounts as such and not to the individual share. Please refer to Section 16.1.3.1 "Norwegian Personal
        Shareholders" for further information in respect of Norwegian share saving accounts.
        16.1.2.2 Norwegian Corporate Shareholders                                 
        Dividends distributed to shareholders who are limited liability companies (and certain similar entities) domiciled in
        Norway for tax purposes ("Norwegian Corporate Shareholders"), are effectively taxed at a rate of currently 0.66%
        (3% of dividend income from such shares is included in the calculation of ordinary income for Norwegian Corporate
        Shareholders and ordinary income is subject to tax at a flat rate of 22% for 2020). For Norwegian Corporate Shareholders
        that are considered to be "Financial Institutions" under the Norwegian financial activity tax (banks, holding companies,
        etc.), the effective rate of taxation for dividends is 0.75%.             
        16.1.2.3 Non-Norwegian Personal Shareholders                              
        Dividends distributed to shareholders who are individuals not resident in Norway for tax purposes ("Non-Norwegian
        Personal Shareholders"), are as a general rule subject to withholding tax at a rate of 25%. The withholding tax rate
        of 25% can be reduced through double tax treaties between Norway and the country in which the shareholder is resident.
        It is the Non-Norwegian Personal Shareholder which is responsible for the registration of residency. The registration will
        be the basis for the calculation of withholding tax on dividends according to the applicable tax treaty. The withholding
        obligation lies with the company distributing the dividends and the Company assumes this obligation.
        All Non-Norwegian Personal Shareholders must document their entitlement to a reduced withholding tax rate by
        obtaining a certificate of residence issued by the tax authorities in the shareholder's country of residence, confirming
        that the shareholder is resident in that state. The documentation must be provided to either the nominee or the account
        operator (i.e. the one who sets up and administrates the VPS account) together with a confirmation that the Non-
        Norwegian Personal Shareholder is the beneficial owner of the dividend.   
        Non-Norwegian Personal Shareholders resident within the EEA for tax purposes may apply individually to Norwegian tax
        authorities for a refund of an amount corresponding to the calculated tax-free allowance on each individual share (please
                                        104                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        see Section 16.1.2.1 "Norwegian Personal Shareholders" above). However, the deduction for the tax-free allowance does
        not apply in the event that the withholding tax rate, pursuant to an applicable tax treaty, leads to a lower taxation of
        dividends than the withholding tax rate of 25% less the tax-free allowance.
        If a Non-Norwegian Personal Shareholder is carrying out business activities in Norway and the shares are effectively
        connected with such activities, the shareholders will be subject to the same taxation dividends as Norwegian Personal
        Shareholders, as described in Section 16.1.2.1 "Norwegian Personal Shareholders" above.
        Non-Norwegian Personal Shareholders who have suffered a higher withholding tax than set out in an applicable tax
        treaty, may apply to the Norwegian tax authorities for a refund of excess withholding tax deducted.
                                                                                  
        Non-Norwegian Personal Shareholders should consult their own advisers regarding the availability of treaty benefits in
        respect of dividend payments, including the possibility of effectively claiming a refund of withholding tax.
        Non-Norwegian Personal Shareholders resident in the EEA for tax purposes may hold their shares through a Norwegian
        share saving account. Dividends received on, and gains derived upon the realisation of, shares held through a share
        saving account by a Non-Norwegian Personal Shareholder resident in the EEA will not be taxed with immediate effect.
        Instead, withdrawal of funds from the share saving account exceeding the Non-Norwegian Personal Shareholder's paid
        in deposit, will be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 25% (unless reduced pursuant to an applicable tax treaty).
        Capital gains realised upon realisation of shares held through the share saving account will be regarded as paid in
        deposits, which may be withdrawn without taxation. Losses will correspondingly be deducted from the paid in deposit,
        reducing the amount which can be withdrawn without withholding tax.       
        The obligation to deduct and report withholding tax on shares held through a share saving account, cf. above, lies with
        the account operator.                                                     
        16.1.2.4 Non-Norwegian Corporate Shareholders                             
        Dividends distributed to shareholders who are limited liability companies (and certain other entities) not resident in
        Norway for tax purposes ("Non-Norwegian Corporate Shareholders"), are as a general rule subject to withholding
        tax at a rate of 25%. The withholding tax rate of 25% is normally reduced through tax treaties between Norway and the
        country in which the shareholder is resident.                             
        Dividends distributed to Non-Norwegian Corporate Shareholders resident within the EEA for tax purposes are exempt
        from Norwegian withholding tax; provided that the shareholder is the beneficial owner of the shares and that the
        shareholder is genuinely established and performs genuine economic business activities within the relevant EEA
        jurisdiction.                                                             
        If a Non-Norwegian Corporate Shareholder is carrying on business activities in Norway and the shares are effectively
        connected with such activities, the shareholder will generally be subject to the same taxation of dividends as Norwegian
        Corporate Shareholders, as described above in Section 16.1.2.2 "Norwegian Corporate Shareholders".
        Non-Norwegian Corporate Shareholders who have suffered a higher withholding tax than set out in the applicable tax
        treaty, may apply to the Norwegian tax authorities for a refund of the excess withholding tax deducted. The same will
        apply to Non-Norwegian Corporate Shareholders who have suffered withholding tax although qualifying for the
        Norwegian participation exemption.                                        
        All Non-Norwegian Corporate Shareholders must document their entitlement to a reduced withholding tax rate by either
        (i) presenting an approved withholding tax refund application or (ii) present an approval from the Norwegian tax
        authorities confirming that the recipient is entitled to a reduced withholding tax rate. In addition, a certificate of residence
        issued by the tax authorities in the shareholder's country of residence, confirming that the shareholder is resident in
        that state, must be obtained. Such documentation must be provided to either the nominee or the account operator (i.e.
        the one who sets up and administrates the VPS account) together with a confirmation that the Non-Norwegian Corporate
        Shareholder is the beneficial owner of the dividend.                      
        Nominees must also obtain an approval from the Norwegian Tax Directorate for the dividend to be subject to a lower
        withholding tax rate than 25%. To obtain such approval, the nominee is required to file a summary to the tax authorities,
        including all beneficial owners that are subject to withholding tax at a reduced rate.
        The withholding obligation in respect of dividend to Non-Norwegian Corporate Shareholders and on nominee registered
        shares lies with the company distributing the dividends and the Company assumes this obligation.
        Non-Norwegian Corporate Shareholders should consult their own advisers regarding the availability of treaty benefits in
        respect of dividend payments, including the possibility of effectively claiming a refund of withholding tax.
        16.1.3 Taxation of capital gains on realisation of shares                 
        16.1.3.1 Norwegian Personal Shareholders                                  
        Sale, redemption or other disposal of shares is considered a realisation for Norwegian tax purposes. A capital gain or
        loss generated by a Norwegian Personal Shareholder through a disposal of shares is taxable or tax deductible in Norway.
        Such capital gain or loss is included in or deducted from the Norwegian Shareholder’s ordinary income in the year of
        disposal. Ordinary income is taxable at a rate of 22%. As for dividends, the ordinary income is adjusted with a factor of
        1.44, giving an effective tax rate of 31.68% (22% x 1.44).                
        The gain is subject to tax and the loss is tax deductible irrespective of the duration of the ownership and the number of
        shares disposed of.                                                       
                                        105                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        The taxable gain/deductible loss is calculated per share as the difference between the consideration for the share and
        the Norwegian Personal Shareholder's cost price of the share, including costs incurred in relation to the acquisition or
        realisation of the share. From this capital gain, Norwegian Personal Shareholders are entitled to deduct a calculated
        allowance provided that such allowance has not already been used to reduce taxable dividend income. Please refer
        Section 16.1.2.1 "Norwegian Personal Shareholders" for a description of the calculation of the allowance. The allowance
        may only be deducted in order to reduce a taxable gain, and cannot increase or produce a deductible loss, i.e. any
        unused allowance exceeding the capital gain upon the realisation of a share will be annulled. Unused allowance may not
        be set off against gains from realisation of other shares.                
        If the Norwegian Personal Shareholder owns shares acquired at different points in time, the shares that were acquired
        first will be regarded as the first to be disposed of, on a first-in first-out basis.
        Special rules apply for Norwegian Personal Shareholders that cease to be tax-resident in Norway.
        Norwegian Personal Shareholders may hold shares through a Norwegian share saving account (Nw.: aksjesparekonto).
        Gains derived upon the realisation of shares held through a share saving account will be exempt from immediate
        Norwegian taxation and losses will not be tax deductible. Instead, withdrawal of funds from the share saving account
        exceeding the Norwegian Personal Shareholder's paid in deposit, will be regarded as taxable income, subject to tax at
        an effective tax rate of 31.68%. Losses are first deductible upon closing of the share savings account. Norwegian Personal
        Shareholders will be entitled to a calculated tax-free allowance provided that such allowance has not already been used
        to reduce taxable dividend income, please see Section 16.1.2.1 "Norwegian Personal Shareholders" above. The tax-free
        allowance is calculated based on the lowest paid in deposit in the account during the income year, plus any unused tax-
        free allowance from previous years. The tax-free allowance can only be deducted in order to reduce taxable income, and
        cannot increase or produce a deductible loss. Any excess allowance may be carried forward and set off against future
        withdrawals from the account or future dividends received on shares held through the account.
        16.1.3.2 Norwegian Corporate Shareholders                                 
        Norwegian Corporate Shareholders are exempt from tax on capital gains generated through the realisation of shares
        qualifying for participation exemption. Losses upon the realisation and costs incurred in connection with the purchase
        and realisation of such shares are not deductible for tax purposes.       
        Special rules apply for Norwegian Corporate Shareholders that cease to be tax-resident in Norway.
        16.1.3.3 Non-Norwegian Personal Shareholders                              
        Capital gains from sale or other disposals made by a Non-Norwegian Personal Shareholders are not subject to taxation
        in Norway, however, a tax liability in Norway may arise if the shares are held in connection with business activities
        carried out or managed from Norway.                                       
        Please refer to Section 16.1.2.3 "Non-Norwegian Personal Shareholders" above for a description of the availability of a
        Norwegian share saving account.                                           
        16.1.3.4 Non-Norwegian Corporate Shareholders                             
        Capital gains generated through realisation of shares by Non-Norwegian Corporate Shareholders are generally not
        subject to taxation in Norway.                                            
        16.1.4 Net Wealth Tax                                                     
        The value of shares is included in the basis for the computation of net wealth tax imposed on Norwegian Personal
        Shareholders. Currently, the marginal net wealth tax rate is 0.85% of the value assessed. The value for assessment
        purposes for listed shares is equal to 65% of the listed value as of 1 January in the year of assessment (i.e. the year
        following the relevant fiscal year). The value of debt allocated to the listed shares for Norwegian wealth tax purposes is
        reduced correspondingly.                                                  
        Please note that the Norwegian Government has proposed that only 55% of the value of the shares is included in the
        basis for the computation of net wealth tax imposed on Norwegian Personal Shareholders. It is further proposed that
        the value for assessment purposes for debt allocated to the shares shall be reduced correspondingly. If the proposals
        are adopted by the Norwegian Parliament, the amendments will be effective as of 1 January 2021.
        Norwegian Corporate Shareholders are not subject to net wealth tax.       
        Shareholders not resident in Norway for tax purposes are not subject to Norwegian net wealth tax. Non-Norwegian
        Personal Shareholders can, however, be taxable if the shareholding is effectively connected to the conduct of trade or
        business in Norway.                                                       
        16.1.5 VAT and transfer taxes                                             
        No VAT, stamp or similar duties are currently imposed in Norway on the transfer or issuance of shares.
        16.1.6 Inheritance tax                                                    
        A transfer of shares through inheritance or as a gift does currently not give rise to inheritance or gift tax in Norway.
        16.2  United States federal income tax considerations                     
        16.2.1 General                                                            
        The following is a description of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders (defined below) of the
        purchase, beneficial ownership and disposition of the Shares, but it does not purport to be a comprehensive description
                                        106                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular person’s decision to acquire the Shares. This discussion
        applies only to U.S. Holders that purchase Shares in this offering and hold the Shares as capital assets for U.S. federal
        income tax purposes. In addition, it does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of a
        U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, including alternative minimum tax consequences, estate and gift tax laws, the
        tax on net investment income, and tax consequences applicable to U.S. Holders subject to special rules, such as:
                   banks or other financial institutions;                        
                   dealers or traders in securities who use a mark-to-market method of tax accounting;
                                                                                  
                   insurance companies;                                          
                   real estate investment trusts;                                
                                                                                  
                   regulated investment companies;                               
                   persons holding Shares as part of a hedging transaction, straddle, wash sale, conversion transaction
                    or integrated transaction or persons entering into a constructive sale with respect to the Shares;
                   persons whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar;
                                                                                  
                   entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
                   tax-exempt entities, including an "individual retirement account" or "Roth IRA" or other tax-
                    deferred accounts;                                            
                   persons that own directly, indirectly or constructively own ten percent or more of the Company’s
                    voting stock or value;                                        
                                                                                  
                   persons who acquired Shares pursuant to the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as
                    compensation; or                                              
                   persons holding Shares in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the United
                    States.                                                       
        If an entity or arrangement that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Shares, the
        U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner of such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner
        and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Shares and partners in such partnerships should consult their
        tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, beneficial ownership and
        disposition of the Shares.                                                
        This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), its legislative history,
        administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), judicial decisions, the income tax
        treaty between Norway and the United States (the "Treaty") and final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations,
        all as of the date hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The Group has not sought
        any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in this discussion, and there
        can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with these statements and conclusions.
        A "U.S. Holder" is a person who, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a beneficial owner of Shares and:
                   a citizen or individual resident of the United States;        
                   a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organised in or under the laws
                    of the United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; or
                   an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
                    source.                                                       
        U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of
        the acquisition, beneficial ownership and disposition of Shares in their particular circumstances.
        This discussion assumes that the Company is not, and will not become, a passive foreign investment company, as
        described below.                                                          
        16.2.2 Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules                           
        Special adverse U.S. federal income tax rules apply to U.S. persons owning shares of a passive foreign investment
        company, or PFIC. A non-U.S. entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will be
        classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year in which, after applying relevant look-
        through rules with respect to certain subsidiaries, either:               
                   at least 75% of its gross income is "passive income" or,      
                   at least 50% of the value of its assets, generally based on their quarterly average, is attributable
                    to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                        107                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        For this purpose, passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents and royalties, gains
        from the disposition of assets that produce passive income and gains from commodities transactions.
                                                                                  
        The Company does not expect to be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the current taxable year or in in the
        foreseeable future. However, whether the Company is a PFIC will be determined annually based upon the composition
        and nature of its income, the composition, nature and valuation of its assets (including goodwill), all of which are subject
        to change (including in the current taxable year), and which may be determined in large part by reference to the market
        value of the Shares, which may be volatile. The determination of whether the Company is a PFIC will also depend upon
        the application of complex U.S. federal income tax rules concerning the classification of the Company’s assets (including
        goodwill) and income for this purpose, and the application of these rules is uncertain in some respects. Accordingly no
        assurance can be provided that the IRS will not successfully assert that the Company has been or will be a PFICfor the
        current year or any subsequent taxable year for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company will not provide annual
        determinations regarding its PFIC status for any taxable year.            
        The Company’s ability to avoid being a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend on its ability to meet, on
        a continuing basis, through actual operating results, certain requirements regarding the nature of its gross assets and
        revenue. In particular, any cash the Company holds, including the cash raised in the Offering, is generally treated as
        held for the production of passive income for the purpose of the PFIC test, and any income generated from cash or other
        liquid assets is generally treated as passive income for such purpose. As a result, the Company’s ability to avoid being
        characterised as a PFIC may depend in part on its ability to deploy proceeds from this or future offerings within limited
        periods of time following such offering.                                  
        If the Company were a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder held Shares, gain recognised by a U.S.
        Holder on a sale or other disposition (including certain pledges) of the Shares would be allocated ratably over the U.S.
        Holder’s holding period for the Shares. The amounts allocated to the taxable year of the sale or other disposition and to
        any year before the Company became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each other
        taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals or corporations, as appropriate, for that
        taxable year, and an interest charge (at the rate generally applicable to underpayments of tax) would be imposed on
        the tax on such amount. Further, to the extent that any distribution received by a U.S. Holder on its Shares exceeds
        125% of the average of the annual distributions on the Shares received during the preceding three years or the U.S.
        Holder’s holding period, whichever is shorter, that distribution would be subject to taxation in the same manner as gain,
        described immediately above. Certain elections may be available that would result in alternative treatments (such as
        mark-to-market or qualified electing fund treatment) of the Shares. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to
        determine whether any of these elections would be available and, if so, what the consequences of the alternative
        treatments would be in their particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should note, however, that the Company does not
        intend to comply with such reporting requirements necessary to permit U.S. Holders to elect to treat the Company as a
        qualified electing fund.                                                  
        16.2.3 Taxation of Distributions                                          
        Distributions paid on Shares, other than certain pro rata distributions of Shares, will be treated as dividends to the extent
        paid out of the Company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax
        principles). To the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds the Company’s current and accumulated earnings
        and profits for a taxable year, the distribution will first be treated as a tax-free return of capital, causing a reduction in
        a U.S. Holder’s tax basis of common shares (but not below zero), and to the extent the amount of the distribution
        exceeds a U.S. Holder’s tax basis, the excess will be taxed as capital gain recognised on a sale or exchange. However,
        because the Company does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles,
        it is expected that distributions in their entirety generally will be reported to U.S. Holders as dividends. Subject to
        applicable limitations, dividends paid to certain non-corporate U.S. Holders may be classified as "qualified dividend
        income" and be taxable at a rate lower than the rates applicable to ordinary income. U.S. Holders should consult their
        tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced tax rate on dividends in their particular circumstances.
        The amount of a dividend will include any amounts withheld by the Company in respect of Norwegian withholding taxes.
        The amount of the dividend will be treated as foreign-source dividend income to U.S. Holders and will not be eligible for
        the dividends-received deduction generally available to U.S. corporations under the Code. Dividends will be included in
        a U.S. Holder’s income on the date of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the dividend. The amount of any dividend income paid
        in NOK will generally be the U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of
        receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. If the dividend is converted into U.S.
        dollars on the date of receipt, a U.S. Holder should not be required to recognise foreign currency gain or loss in respect
        of the dividend income. A U.S. Holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars
        after the date of receipt, and any such gain or loss will be U.S.-source ordinary income or loss.
        Subject to applicable limitations, some of which vary depending upon the U.S. Holder’s circumstances, Norwegian taxes
        withheld from dividends on Shares (at a rate not exceeding the Treaty rate for U.S. Holders entitled for Treaty benefits)
        may be creditable against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. Dividends paid by the Company on the
        shares will generally constitute "passive category income" or in certain cases "general category income" for foreign tax
        credit purposes. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex, and U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors
        regarding the creditability of foreign taxes in their particular circumstances or the ability to deduct foreign taxes in lieu
        of claiming a foreign tax credit and any applicable limitations.          
        16.2.4 Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Shares                        
        For U.S. federal income tax purposes, gain or loss realised on the sale or other disposition of Shares will be capital gain
        or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Shares for more than one year. The amount
        of the gain or loss will equal the difference between the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Shares disposed of and
        the amount realised on the disposition, in each case as determined in U.S. dollars. This gain or loss will generally be
                                        108                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        U.S.-source gain or loss for foreign tax credit purposes. Consequently, in the case of gain from the disposition of Shares
        that is subject to Norwegian tax, if any, a U.S. Holder may not be able to claim as a foreign tax credit any Norwegian
        tax paid, unless the U.S. Holder can apply the credit against U.S. federal income tax payable on other foreign source
        income in the appropriate income category. Non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) generally will be subject
        to U.S. federal income tax on long-term capital gains at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject
        to limitations.                                                           
        A U.S. Holder’s initial tax basis on the Shares will be the U.S. dollar value of the NOK denominated purchase price
        determined on the date of purchase. With respect to the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of Shares, the
        amount realised generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the payment received determined on (1) the date of actual or
        constructive receipt of payment in the case of a cash basis U.S. Holder and (2) the date of disposition in the case of an
        accrual basis U.S. Holder. If the Shares are traded on an "established securities market", a cash basis U.S. Holder, or
        an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price of the Shares or the
        amount realised based on the exchange rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale, as applicable. If a U.S.
        Holder sells or otherwise disposes of the Shares in exchange for currency other than U.S. dollars, any gain or loss that
        results from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date of the sale or other disposition (in the case
        of non-electing accrual basis U.S. Holders) or the date of settlement (in the case of cash basis and electing accrual basis
        U.S. Holders) until the date that the currency is converted into U.S. dollars generally will be treated as ordinary income
        or loss and will not be eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains. Such gain or loss generally
        will be U.S.-source income or loss. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the treatment of
        any foreign currency gain or loss realised with respect to any currency received in a sale or other disposition of the
        Shares that is converted into U.S. dollars (or otherwise disposed of) on a date subsequent to receipt.
        16.2.5 Information Reporting and Backup Withholding                       
        Payments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related financial
        intermediaries generally are subject to information reporting, and may be subject to backup withholding, unless (i) the
        U.S. Holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (ii) in the case of backup withholding, the U.S. Holder provides
        a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding.
        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will
        be allowed as a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund, provided that
        the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.                  
        In addition, if you are an individual, you should be aware that additional reporting requirements apply (including a
        requirement to file IRS Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Assets) with respect to the holding of certain foreign
        financial assets, including stock of foreign issuers which is not held in an account maintained by certain financial
        institutions, if the aggregate value of all of such assets exceeds USD 50,000 at the end of the taxable year or USD
        75,000 at any time during the taxable year. The thresholds are higher for individuals living outside of the United States
        and married couples filing jointly. Prospective investors are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the
        implications of this requirement on their investment in the Shares.       
        The above discussion is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating to
        the purchase, beneficial ownership and disposition of the Shares. You should consult your own tax advisor
        concerning the tax consequences applicable in your particular situation.

                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        17    THE TERMS OF THE OFFERING                                           
                                                                                  
        17.1  Overview of the Offering                                            
        The Offering consists of (i) an offer of up to 53,200,000 New Shares, each with a nominal value of NOK 0.005, to raise
        gross proceeds of up to approximately NOK 2,500 million and (ii) an offer of up to 74,500,000 Sale Shares, all of which
        are existing, validly issued and fully paid registered Shares with a nominal value of NOK 0.005 each, offered by the
        Selling Shareholders. Reference is made to Section 14 "Selling Shareholders" for more information on the Selling
        Shareholders and the Sale Shares. The Offer Price at which the Shares will be sold is NOK 47.00 per Offer Share.
        In addition, the Managers may elect to over-allot up to 19,155,000 Additional Shares, equal to up to 15% of the total
        number of New Shares and Sale Shares sold in the Offering. The Lending Selling Shareholders, are expected to grant
        the Stabilisation Manager, on behalf of the Managers, an option to purchase, at the Offer Price, a number of Shares
        equal to up to the number of Additional Shares to cover any short positions resulting from any over-allotments made in
        connection with the Offering. The Over-Allotment Option will be exercisable, in whole or in part, by the Stabilisation
        Manager, on behalf of the Managers, within a 30-day period commencing at the time at which "if issued/if sold" trading
        in the Shares commences on the Oslo Stock Exchange, on the terms and subject to the conditions described in this
        Prospectus. Assuming that the maximum number of Sale Shares is sold and the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in
        full, the Offering will amount to 146,855,000 Offer Shares.               
        The Offering consists of:                                                 
                   An Institutional Offering, in which Offer Shares are being offered to (a) institutional investors in
                    Norway, (b) institutional and certain other eligible investors outside Norway and the United States,
                    subject to applicable exemptions from the prospectus and registration requirements, and (c)
                    investors in the United States who are reasonably believed to be QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A or
                    another available exemption from, or in transactions not subject to, the registration requirements
                    under the U.S. Securities Act. The Institutional Offering is subject to a minimum amount per
                    application of NOK 2,500,000.                                 
                   A Retail Offering, in which Offer Shares are being offered to the public in Norway subject to a
                    minimum amount per application of NOK 10,500 and an upper limit per application of NOK
                    2,499,999 for each investor. Investors who intend to place an order in excess of NOK 2,499,999
                    must do so in the Institutional Offering. Multiple applications by one applicant in the Retail Offering
                    will be treated as one application with respect to the maximum application limit.
        All offers and sales in the United States will be made only to investors who are reasonably believed to be QIBs in reliance
        on Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements
        of the U.S. Securities Act. All offers and sales outside the United States will be made in "offshore transactions" as defined
        in, and in compliance with, Regulation S of the U.S. Securities Act.      
        This Prospectus does not constitute an offer of, or an invitation to purchase, the Offer Shares in any jurisdiction in which
        such offer or sale would be unlawful. For further details, see "Important Information" and Section 18 "Selling and transfer
        restrictions".                                                            
        The Bookbuilding Period for the Institutional Offering is expected to take place from 14 October 2020 at 09:00 hours
        (CEST) to 20 October 2020 at 14:00 hours (CEST). The Application Period for the Retail Offering is expected to take
        place from 14 October 2020 at 09:00 hours (CEST) to 20 October 2020 at 12:00 hours (CEST). The Company and the
        Principal Shareholder, in consultation with the Managers, reserve the right to extend the Bookbuilding Period and the
        Application Period at any time. Any extension of the Bookbuilding Period and/or the Application Period will be announced
        through the Oslo Stock Exchange's information system on or before 09:00 hours (CEST) on the first business day
        following the then prevailing expiration date of the Bookbuilding Period and/or the Application Period. An extension of
        the Bookbuilding Period and/or the Application Period can be made one or several times provided, however, that in no
        event will the Bookbuilding Period and/or the Application Period be extended beyond 14:00 hours (CEST) on 30 October
        2020. In the event of an extension of the Bookbuilding Period and/or the Application Period, the allocation date, the
        payment due dates and the date of delivery of Offer Shares will be changed accordingly, but the date of the Listing and
        commencement of trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange may not necessarily be changed. If the Application Period is
        extended beyond 25 October 2020, all relevant references to central European summer time (CEST) will be central
        European time (CET).                                                      
        The Offer Price at which the Shares will be sold is NOK 47.00 per Offer Share. Assuming that all the Sale Shares are sold
        in the Offering (i.e. excluding any over-allotments), the gross proceeds of the Offering will be approximately NOK 2,500
        million. Seven cornerstone investors have undertaken to acquire and will be allocated Offer Shares for a total amount of
        minimum NOK 2,300 million, subject to certain conditions. These seven cornerstone investors are i) Swedbank Robur
        Fonder (NOK 600 million committed), ii) DNB Asset Management (NOK 500 million committed), iii) The Government
        Pension Fund of Norway, Folketrygdfondet (NOK 500 million committed), iv) Delphi Funds, a part of Storebrand Asset
        Management AS (NOK 250 million committed), v) Luxor Capital Group (NOK 175 million committed), vi) TIN Fonder
        (NOK 175 million committed) and vii) Didner & Gerge Fonder (NOK 100 million committed). The Company and the
        Principal Shareholder, in consultation with the Managers, will determine the number of Offer Shares on the basis of the
        bookbuilding process in the Institutional Offering and the applications received in the Retail Offering. Based on the
        demand for Offer Shares in the bookbuilding process and applications received in the Retail Offering, the number of Sale
        Shares sold by the Selling Shareholders may be reduced from the maximum number set out in this Prospectus and it
        may be decided not to sell any Sale Shares at all.                        
        The Company expects that, on or around 20 October 2020, it will together with the Principal Shareholder enter into an
        underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with the Managers with respect to the Offering.
                                        110                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        Furthermore, it is expected that the Selling Shareholders, other than the Principal Shareholder, on or around 20 October
        2020 will enter into a placing agreement with ABGSC with respect to the Offering (the "Placing Agreement" and,
        together with the Underwriting Agreement, the "Purchase Agreement"). On the terms, and subject to the conditions
        set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and provided that the Purchase Agreement has not been terminated prior thereto
        in accordance with the terms thereof, the Managers are expected to agree to procure subscribers for the New Shares
        and purchasers for the Sale Shares or, failing which, to subscribe for the New Shares and purchase the Sale Shares
        themselves, severally and not jointly.                                    
        The purchase commitments of each of the Managers will be determined in conjunction with the determination of the
        final number of Offer Shares to be sold in the Offering, which is expected to take place on 20 October 2020. On the
        terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, the Joint Bookrunners are, in order to
        provide for prompt registration of the New Shares with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises, on or about
        22 October 2020 expected to prefund payment for the New Shares allocated in the Offering at a total subscription price
        equal to the Offer Price multiplied by the number of such New Shares.     
        The Lending Selling Shareholders, are expected to grant to the Stabilisation Manager on behalf of the Managers an
        option (the "Over-Allotment Option") to purchase up to 19,155,000 Additional Shares at the Offer Price, comprising
        up to approximately 15% of the total number of New Shares and Sale Shares sold in the Offering, to cover short positions
        resulting from any overallotments made in connection with the Offering. The Over-Allotment Option will be exercisable,
        in whole or in part, by the Stabilisation Manager, on behalf of the Managers, within a 30-day period commencing at the
        time at which "if issued/if sold" trading in the Shares commences on the Oslo Stock Exchange, which is expected to be
        on or around 09:00 hours (CEST) on 21 October 2020. See Section 17.11.1 "Over-Allotment of Additional Shares" for
        further details. In order to permit delivery in respect of over-allotments made, if any, the Lending Selling shareholders
        are, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, expected to grant the Managers, an option (the "Lending Option") to require
        the Lending Selling Shareholders to lend to the Stabilisation Manager, on behalf of the Managers, a number of Shares
        equal to the number of over-allotted Shares.                              
        The Company and the Selling Shareholders will make certain representations and warranties and will agree to certain
        undertakings in the Purchase Agreement. The Company will, to the fullest extent permitted by Norwegian law, undertake,
        subject to certain conditions and limitations, to indemnify the Managers against certain liabilities in connection with the
        Offering, including liabilities under applicable securities laws.         
        Through the Purchase Agreement, the Company and the Selling Shareholders will give an undertaking that will restrict
        their ability to issue, sell or transfer Shares for 180 days after the first day of Listing (other than the CEO, whose lock-
        up undertaking will be 365 days from the first day of Listing). For more information about these restrictions, please see
        Section 17.18 “Lock-up” below.                                            
        The Underwriting Agreement is expected to provide that the Joint Global Coordinators (on behalf of the Managers) may
        terminate the Underwriting Agreement (and thereby automatically the Placing Agreement), and thus the Managers'
        obligation to procure purchasers for, or failing to which to themselves to purchase the Offer Shares, if prior to the 07:30
        CEST on the first day of conditional trading (expected to take place on or about 21 October 2020 as described below)
        (i) there has been, in the reasonable opinion of the Joint Global Coordinators, and actual or prospective material adverse
        change, or any development reasonably expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
        change, in the financial condition, or in the prospects (by reference to the financial condition of the Company), earnings,
        solvency, liquidity position, business or operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) there has
        been any breach of, or any event rendering untrue or incorrect in any respect, any of the representations, warranties or
        covenants contained in any provision of the Underwriting Agreement, in each case, which has greater than de minimis
        adverse effect; (iii) any of the conditions to the Managers' obligations as set out in the Underwriting Agreement has not
        been satisfied or waived by the Joint Global Coordinators by the dates set out therein; (iv) there has occurred any event
        or circumstance or exists any condition that would require the publication of a supplement or amendment to this
        Prospectus pursuant to applicable law or regulation; (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of
        hostilities, acts of terrorism, declaration of emergency or martial law or any change in financial markets, currency
        exchange rates, any change in political conditions or controls or any calamity, crisis or force majeure event that, in the
        good faith judgement of the Joint Global Coordinators, following consultation, to the extent practicable, with the
        Company and the Principal Shareholder, is material and adverse and which, individually or together with any other event
        specified above, makes it, in the good faith judgement of the Joint Global Coordinators, impracticable or inadvisable to
        proceed with the Offering, sale or delivery of the Offer Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the
        Prospectus or the pricing statement, or which would materially and adversely prejudice the success of the Offering or
        dealings in Offer Shares in the secondary market; or (vi) any of the following has occurred: (1) trading generally shall
        have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the Oslo Stock Exchange, the London
        Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Global Market or maximum or minimum prices for trading
        have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices of securities have been required by any of said exchanges or by such
        system or by order of any governmental authority, (2) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been
        suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (3) a material disruption in securities settlement,
        payment or clearance services in Norway, the United States, or in the EEA shall have occurred, or (4) any moratorium
        on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Norwegian, British or U.S. Federal or New York State
        authorities, if the effect of any such event specified in clauses (1) through (4) above makes it impracticable or
        inadvisable, in the judgement of the Joint Global Coordinators acting in good faith, taking into account general market
        conditions as a result of such events and the interest of investors in the Offer Shares, to proceed with the sale or delivery
        of the Offer Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
        In addition, the Underwriting Agreement is expected to provide that the Joint Global Coordinators (on behalf of the
        Managers) may terminate the Underwriting Agreement (and thereby automatically the Placing Agreement) and thus the
        Managers' obligation to procure subscribers and purchasers for, or failing to which to subscribe and purchase the Offer
                                        111                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        Shares themselves if prior to 17:00 hours (CEST) on 22 October 2020 one of the following events (each a "force
        majeure" event) occurs:                                                   
                                                                                  
        (1) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the Oslo
        Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Global Market or maximum
        or minimum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices of securities have been required by any
        of said exchanges or by such system or by order of any governmental authority, (2) a material disruption in securities
        settlement, payment or clearance services in Norway, the United States, or in the EEA shall have occurred, or (3) any
        moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Norwegian, British or U.S. Federal or New
        York State authorities, if the effect of any such event specified in clauses (1) through (3) above makes it impossible, in
        the judgement of the Joint Global Coordinators, on behalf of the Managers, acting in good faith, taking into account
        general market conditions as a result of such events and the interest of investors in the Offer Shares, to proceed with
        the sale or delivery of the Offer Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in this Prospectus.
        Further, the Underwriting Agreement is expected to provide that the Joint Global Coordinators (on behalf of the
        Managers) may terminate the Underwriting Agreement if, prior to 17:00 hours (CEST) on 22 October 2020, (i) a Manager
        (or Managers) defaults in its obligation to subscribe/purchase the number of Offer Shares it has agreed to
        subscribe/purchase under the Underwriting Agreement, and (ii) the aggregate number of Offer Shares with respect to
        which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the total number of Offer Shares which all Managers are obligated to purchase
        under the Underwriting Agreement, and (iii) arrangements satisfactory to the Joint Global Coordinators, on behalf of the
        Managers, the Company and the Principal Shareholder for the purchase of such Offer Shares have not been made.
        Unless the Underwriting Agreement has been terminated, delivery of the Offer Shares to investors being allocated Offer
        Shares in the Offering is expected to take place on or about 23 October 2020 in the Retail Offering subject to due
        payment for allocated Offer Shares having been received from investors, and on or about 23 October 2020 in the
        Institutional Offering (on a delivery versus payment basis).              
        The Offer Shares allocated in the Offering are expected to be traded on the Oslo Stock Exchange on a
        conditional "if issued/if sold" basis from and including 21 October 2020 to and including 22 October 2020.
        Trades during this period will, in accordance with the ordinary settlement cycle for trades over the Oslo
        Stock Exchange, be settled on T+2 (T being the trade date). Accordingly, any trade made on 21 October
        2020 will be settled on 23 October 2020. Should any of the termination events described above occur in the
        period from commencement of conditional trading in the Shares (expected to take place on 21 October
        2020) to commencement of unconditional trading in the Shares (expected to take place on 23 October 2020
        as described below), and the Underwriting Agreement is terminated, no trades that have occurred in the
        Shares will be settled, and investors will have no right to compensation for any loss suffered as a result of
        such cancellation and payments made will be returned without any interest or other compensation. All
        dealings in the Shares prior to settlement and delivery are at the sole risk of the parties concerned.
        Depending on the policy of their respective bank or investment firm, investors wanting to trade their allocated Offer
        Shares through an internet account prior to commencement of unconditional trading in the Shares (expected to take
        place on 23 October 2020), may be prevented from such trading. Investors wanting to trade their allocated Offer Shares
        through an internet account prior to commencement of unconditional trading are therefore urged to confirm the
        possibility of such trading with their own account operator.              
        Completion of the Offering is conditional upon, among other conditions, the Company satisfying the listing conditions
        and being listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. See Section 17.15 "Conditions for completion of the Offering – Listing and
        trading of the Offer Shares".                                             
        See Section 17.16 "Expenses of the Offering and the Listing" for information regarding fees expected to be paid to the
        Managers and costs expected to be paid by the Company in connection with the Offering and pursuant to the Purchase
        Agreement. The Purchase Agreement is also expected to provide that the Company and the Selling Shareholders will
        indemnify the Managers against certain losses and liabilities arising out of or in connection with the Offering.
        17.2  Timetable

        Note that the Company and the Principal Shareholder, together with the Managers, reserve the right to extend the
        Bookbuilding Period and/or the Application Period at their sole discretion. In the event of an extension of the Bookbuilding
        Period and/or the Application Period, the allocation date, the payment due dates and the dates of delivery of Offer Shares
        may be changed accordingly, but the date of the Listing and commencement of trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange will
        not necessarily be changed.                                               
        17.3  Resolution relating to the Offering and the issue of New Shares     
        On 2 October 2020 the general meeting of the Company made the following resolution to authorise the Board to issue
        shares in connection with the Offering and Listing:                       
              a)    The board of directors is granted the authorization to increase the Company's share capital by up
                    to NOK 374,847 in connection with the IPO, including to cover any potential over-allotment options
                    to be granted by the Company, in one or more share capital increases through issuance of new
                    shares.

              c)    The authorization is valid until the Company's annual general meeting in 2021, but no longer than
                    to and including 30 June 2021.                                
                                                                                  
              d)    Existing shareholders' preferential rights to subscribe for and be allocated new shares may be
                    deviated from.                                                
              e)    This authorization does not comprise share capital increases against contribution in kind and the
                    right for the Company to incur specific obligations.          
              f)    The authorization does not comprise capital increases in connection with mergers.
                                                                                  
              g)    The board is authorized to determine the most practical structure and further conditions for the
                    share capital increase(s).                                    
                                                                                  
              h)    This board authorization replaces the board authorization granted by the extraordinary general
                    meeting on 7 January 2020.                                    
              i)    The board is authorized to make the necessary amendments to the articles of association to reflect
                    the share capital increases resolved pursuant to this authorization..
        Following expiry of the Bookbuilding Period and the Application Period on or about 20 October 2020, the Board of
        Directors will consider and, if thought fit, approve the completion of the Offering and, in consultation with the Managers,
        determine the final number and allocation of the Offer Shares. If the Board of Directors determine that the Offering shall
        be completed, the Board of Directors will proceed to increase the share capital of the Company by issuance of the New
        Shares. The New Shares are expected to be issued on or around 22 October 2020.
        The existing shareholders' pre-emptive rights to subscribe for and be allocated Shares will be deviated from in order to
        be able to issue the New Shares to investors in the Offering and thereby comply with the conditions for Listing for the
        benefit of the Company and existing shareholders.

        The Company and the Principal Shareholder may, in consultation with the Managers, extend the Bookbuilding Period at
        any time, and on one or several occasions. The Bookbuilding Period may in no event be extended beyond 14:00 hours
        (CET) on 30 October 2020. In the event of an extension of the Bookbuilding Period, the allocation date, the payment
        due date and the date of delivery of Offer Shares may be changed accordingly, but the date of the Listing and
        commencement of trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange will not necessarily be changed.
        17.4.2 Minimum application                                                
        The Institutional Offering is subject to a minimum application of NOK 2,500,000 per application. Investors in Norway

        17.4.3 Application procedure

        All applications in the Institutional Offering will be treated in the same manner regardless of which Manager the applicant
        chooses to place the application with. Any orally placed application in the Institutional Offering will be binding for the
        investor and subject to the same terms and conditions as a written application. The Managers may, at any time and in
        their sole discretion, require the investor to confirm orally placed applications in writing. Applications made may be
        withdrawn or amended by the investor at any time up to the expiry of the Bookbuilding Period. At the close of the
        Bookbuilding Period, all applications in the Institutional Offering that have not been withdrawn or amended are
        irrevocable and binding for the investor.                                 
        17.4.4 Allocation, payment for and delivery of Offer Shares               
        The Managers expect to issue notifications of allocation of Offer Shares in the Institutional Offering on or about
        21 October 2020, by issuing contract notes to the applicants by mail or otherwise.
        Payment by applicants in the Institutional Offering will take place against delivery of Offer Shares. Delivery and payment
        for Offer Shares is expected to take place on or about 23 October 2020 (the "Institutional Closing Date") through the
        facilities of the VPS. The delivery and payment of Offer Shares may not take place on the Institutional Closing Date, or
        at all, if certain conditions or events referred to in the Purchase Agreement are not satisfied or waived or occur on or
        prior to such date. See Section 17.1 "Overview of the Offering".          
        For late payment, interest will accrue on the amount due at a rate equal to the prevailing interest rate under the
        Norwegian Act on Overdue Payment of 17 December 1976 no. 100 (the "Norwegian Act on Overdue Payment"),
        which, at the date of this Prospectus, is 8% per annum. Should payment not be made when due, the Offer Shares
        allocated will not be delivered to the applicants, and the Managers reserve the right, at the risk and cost of the applicant,
        to cancel the application and to re-allot, from the third day after the Institutional Closing Date, or otherwise dispose of
        the allocated Offer Shares on such terms and in such manner as the Managers may decide (and the applicant will not
        be entitled to any profit therefrom). The original applicant remains liable for payment for the Offer Shares allocated to
        the applicant, together with any interest, cost, charges and expenses accrued, and the Company, and/or the Managers
        may enforce payment of any such amount outstanding.                       
        In order to provide for prompt registration of the share capital increase in the Company relating to the issuance of the
        New Shares with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises, the Joint Bookrunners are expected to pre-fund the
        New Shares allocated in the Offering at a total subscription amount equal to the Offer Price multiplied by the number of
        New Shares allocated in the Offering. Irrespective of any such prefunding, the original applicant will remain liable for
        payment of the Offer Price for the Offer Shares allocated to the applicant, together with any interest, costs, charges and
        expenses accrued, and the Company and/or the Managers may enforce payment of any such amount outstanding. The
        prefunding by the Joint Bookrunners of the New Shares as described above forms part of an integrated sales process
        where the investors purchase New Shares from the Company based on this Prospectus, which has been prepared by the
        Company. By purchasing Offer Shares, the investors waive any rights or claims against any of the Managers.
        17.5  The Retail Offering                                                 
        17.5.1 Application Period                                                 
        The Application Period during which applications for Offer Shares in the Retail Offering will be accepted will last from
        14 October 2020 at 09:00 hours (CEST) to 20 October at 12:00 hours (CEST), unless extended. The Company and the
        Principal Shareholder may, in consultation with the Managers, extend the Application Period, at any time, and for any
        reason, and on one or several occasions. The Application Period may, in no event, be extended beyond 14:00 hours
        (CET) on 30 October 2020. In the event of an extension of the Application Period, the allocation date, the payment due
        date and the date of delivery of Offer Shares may be changed accordingly, but the date of the Listing and commencement
        of trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange will not necessarily be changed.    
        17.5.2 Minimum and maximum application                                    
        The Retail Offering is subject to a minimum application amount of NOK 10,500 and a maximum application amount of
        NOK 2,499,999 for each applicant.                                         
        Multiple applications are allowed. One or multiple applications from the same applicant in the Retail Offering with a total
        application amount in excess of NOK 2,499,999 will be adjusted downwards to an application amount of NOK 2,499,999.
        If two or more identical application forms are received from the same investor, the application form will only be counted
        once unless otherwise explicitly stated on one of the application forms. In the case of multiple applications through the
        VPS online application system or applications made both on a physical application form and through the VPS online
        application system, all applications will be counted. Investors who intend to place an order in excess of NOK 2,499,999
        must do so in the Institutional Offering.

        All applications in the Retail Offering will be treated in the same manner regardless of which of the above Managers the
        applications are placed with. Further, all applications in the Retail Offering will be treated in the same manner regardless
        of whether they are submitted by delivery of a Retail Application Form or through the VPS online application system.
        Retail Application Forms that are incomplete or incorrectly completed, electronically or physically, or that are received
        after the expiry of the Application Period, may be disregarded without further notice to the applicant. The same applies
        to applications that are unlawful. Properly completed Retail Application Forms must be received by one of the application
        offices listed above or registered electronically through the VPS application system by 12:00 hours (CEST) on 20 October
        2020, unless the Application Period is being extended. None of the Company, the Selling Shareholders or any of the
        Managers may be held responsible for postal delays, unavailable internet lines or servers or other logistical or technical
        matters that may result in applications not being received in time or at all by any application office.
        All applications made in the Retail Offering will be irrevocable and binding upon receipt of a duly completed Retail
        Application Form, or in the case of applications through the VPS online application system, upon registration of the
        application, irrespective of any shortening or extension of the Application Period, and cannot be withdrawn, cancelled or
        modified by the applicant after having been received by the application office, or in the case of applications through the
        VPS online application system, upon registration of the application.      
        17.5.4 Allocation, payment and delivery of Offer Shares                   
        ABGSC, acting as settlement agent for the Retail Offering, expects to issue notifications of allocation of Offer Shares in
        the Retail Offering on or around 21 October 2020, by issuing allocation notes to the applicants by mail or otherwise. Any
        applicant wishing to know the precise number of Offer Shares allocated to it, may contact one of the application offices
        listed above on or around 21 October during business hours. Applicants who have access to investor services through
        an institution that operates the applicant's account with the VPS for the registration of holdings of securities ("VPS
        Account") should be able to see how many Offer Shares they have been allocated from on or around 21 October 2020.
        In registering an application through the VPS online application system or completing a Retail Application Form, each
        applicant in the Retail Offering will authorize ABGSC (on behalf of the Managers) to debit the applicant's Norwegian bank
        account for the total amount due for the Offer Shares allocated to the applicant. The applicant's bank account number
        must be stipulated on the VPS online application or on the Retail Application Form. Accounts will be debited on or around
        22 October 2020 (the "Payment Date"), and there must be sufficient funds in the stated bank account from and
        including 21 October 2020. Applicants who do not have a Norwegian bank account must ensure that payment for the
        allocated Offer Shares is made on or before the Payment Date (expected to be 22 October 2020). The delivery and
        payment for Offer Shares may not take place on the Payment Date or at all if certain conditions or events referred to in
        the Purchase Agreement are not satisfied or waived or occur on or prior to such date. See Section 17.1 "Overview of the
        Offering".                                                                
        Further details and instructions will be set out in the allocation notes to the applicant to be issued on or around
        21 October 2020, or can be obtained by contacting ABGSC at +47 22 01 60 00.
        Should any applicant have insufficient funds on his or her account, or should payment be delayed for any reason, or if
        it is not possible to debit the account, interest will accrue on the amount due at a rate equal to the prevailing interest
        rate under the Norwegian Act on Overdue Payment, which at the date of this Prospectus is 8% per annum. ABGSC (on
        behalf of the Managers) reserves the right (but has no obligation) to make up to three debit attempts through 29 October
        2020 if there are insufficient funds on the account on the Payment Date. Should payment not be made when due, the
        Offer Shares allocated will not be delivered to the applicant, and the Company and the Managers reserve the right, at
        the risk and cost of the applicant, to cancel at any time thereafter the application and to re-allot or, from the third day
        after the Payment Date, otherwise dispose of the allocated Offer Shares, on such terms and in such manner as the
        Managers may decide (and that the applicant will not be entitled to any profit therefrom). The original applicant will
        remain liable for payment of the Offer Price for the Offer Shares allocated to the applicant, together with any interest,
                                        115                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        costs, charges and expenses accrued, and the Company and the Managers may enforce payment of any such amount
        outstanding.                                                              
                                                                                  
        In order to provide for prompt registration of the share capital increase in the Company relating to the issuance of the
        New Shares with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises, the Joint Bookrunners are expected to pre-fund the
        New Shares allocated in the Offering at a total subscription amount equal to the Offer Price multiplied by the number of
        New Shares allocated in the Offering. Irrespective of any such prefunding, the original applicant will remain liable for
        payment of the Offer Price for the Offer Shares allocated to the applicant, together with any interest, costs, charges and
        expenses accrued, and the Company and/or the Managers may enforce payment of any such amount outstanding. The
        prefunding by the Joint Bookrunners of the New Shares as described above forms part of an integrated sales process
        where the investors purchase New Shares from the Company based on this Prospectus, which has been prepared by the
        Company. By purchasing Offer Shares, investors waive any rights or claims against any of the Managers.
        Subject to timely payment by the applicant, delivery of the Offer Shares allocated in the Retail Offering is expected to
        take place on or around 23 October 2020.                                  
        17.6  Mechanism of allocation                                             
        It has been provisionally assumed that approximately 90-99% of the Offering will be allocated in the Institutional Offering
        and that approximately 1-10% of the Offering will be allocated in the Retail Offering. The final determination of the
        number of Offer Shares allocated to the Institutional Offering and the Retail Offering will only be decided, however, by
        the Company and the Principal Shareholder, in consultation with the Joint Bookrunners, following the completion of the
        bookbuilding process for the Institutional Offering, based on, among other things, the level of orders or applications
        received from each of the categories of investors relative to the level of applications or orders received in the Retail
        Offering. The Company, the Principal Shareholder and the Joint Bookrunners reserve the right to deviate from the
        provisionally assumed allocation between tranches without further notice and at their sole discretion.
        No Offer Shares have been reserved for any specific national market.      
        In the Institutional Offering, the Company and the Principal Shareholder, together with the Joint Bookrunners, will
        determine the allocation of Offer Shares. An important aspect of the allocation principles is the desire to create an
        appropriate long term shareholder structure for the Company. The allocation principles will, in accordance with normal
        practice for institutional placements, include factors such as premarketing and management road-show participation and
        feedback, timeliness of the order, relative order size, sector knowledge, investment history, perceived investor quality
        and investment horizon. The Company, the Principal Shareholder and the Joint Bookrunners further reserve the right,
        at their sole discretion, to take into account the creditworthiness of any applicant. The Company, the Principal
        Shareholder and the Joint Bookrunners may also set a maximum allocation, or decide to make no allocation to any
        applicant. In addition, seven cornerstone investors have undertaken to acquire and will be allocated Offer Shares for a
        minimum total amount of NOK 2,300 million in the Offering, subject to certain conditions. These seven cornerstone
        investors are i) Swedbank Robur Fonder (NOK 600 million committed), ii) DNB Asset Management (NOK 500 million
        committed), iii) The Government Pension Fund of Norway, Folketrygdfondet (NOK 500 million committed), iv) Delphi
        Funds, a part of Storebrand Asset Management AS (NOK 250 million committed), v) Luxor Capital Group (NOK 175
        million committed), vi) TIN Fonder (NOK 175 million committed) and vii) Didner & Gerge Fonder (NOK 100 million
        committed).                                                               
        In the Retail Offering, no allocations will be made for a number of Offer Shares representing an aggregate value of less
        than NOK 10,500 per applicant, provided, however, that all allocations will be rounded down to the nearest number of
        whole Offer Shares and the payable amount will hence be adjusted accordingly.
        One or multiple orders from the same applicant in the Retail Offering with a total application amount in excess of
        NOK 2,499,999 will be adjusted downwards to an application amount of NOK 2,499,999. In the Retail Offering, allocation
        will be made solely on a pro rata basis using the VPS' automated simulation procedures. However, so that the Company,
        in consultation with the Joint Bookrunners, reserves the right to grant members of the managers and the Board, being
        primary insiders in the Company, full allocation within their application.
        The Company, the Principal Shareholder and the Joint Bookrunners reserve the right to limit the total number of
        applicants to whom Offer Shares are allocated if the Company and the Joint Bookrunners deem this to be necessary in
        order to keep the number of shareholders in the Company at an appropriate level and such limitation does not have the
        effect that any conditions for the Listing regarding the number of shareholders will not be satisfied. If the Company, the
        Principal Shareholder and the Joint Bookrunners should decide to limit the total number of applicants to whom Offer
        Shares are allocated, the applicants to whom Offer Shares are allocated will be determined on a random basis by using
        the VPS' automated simulation procedures and/or other random allocation mechanisms. The Company, the Principal
        Shareholder and the Joint Bookrunners reserve the right to set a maximum allocation per applicant in the Retail Offering.
        17.7  VPS account                                                         
        To participate in the Offering, each applicant must have a VPS account. The VPS account number must be stated when
        registering an application through the VPS online application system or on the Retail Application Form for the Retail
        Offering. VPS accounts can be established with authorised VPS registrars, which can be Norwegian banks, authorised
        investment firms in Norway and Norwegian branches of credit institutions established within the EEA. However, non-
        Norwegian investors may use nominee VPS accounts registered in the name of a nominee. The nominee must be
        authorised by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance. Establishment of VPS accounts requires verification of identification by
        the relevant VPS registrar in accordance with Norwegian anti-money laundering legislation (see Section 17.10
        "Mandatory anti-money laundering procedures").                            
                                        116                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        17.8  Product governance                                                  
        Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on
        markets in financial instruments, as amended (MiFID II); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive (EU)
        2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures (the MiFID II Product Governance
        Requirements), and disclaiming all and any liability, which any "manufacturer" (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product
        Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the Shares have been subject to a product approval
        process, which has determined that they each are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and
        investors who meet the criteria of professional customers and eligible counterparties, each as defined in MiFID II (the
        Positive Target Market); and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution channels as are permitted by MiFID II
        (the Appropriate Channels for Distribution).                              
        Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, Distributors should note that: the price of Shares may decline and
        investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection;
        and an investment in the Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital
        protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating
        the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may
        result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or
        regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Offering. Furthermore, it is noted that, notwithstanding the Target Market
        Assessment, the Managers will only procure investors who meet the criteria of professional customers and eligible
        counterparties.                                                           
        For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or
        appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest
        in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Shares.
        Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Shares and determining
        appropriate distribution channels.                                        
        Investors should, however, note that the price of the Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their
        investment; the Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Shares is
        compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in
        conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an
        investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. Conversely, it is
        the assessment of the manufacturers that an investment in the Shares is not compatible with investors looking for full
        capital protection or full repayment of the amount invested or having no risk tolerance, or investors requiring a fully
        guaranteed income or fully predictable return profile (the Negative Target Market, and, together with the Positive Target
        Market, the Target Market Assessment).                                    
        17.9  National Client Identifier and Legal Entity Identifier              
        In order to participate in the Offering, applicants will need a global identification code. Physical persons will need a so
        called National Client Identifier ("NCI") and legal entities will need a so called Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). Investors
        who do not already have an NCI or LEI, as applicable, must obtain such codes in time for the application in order to
        participate in the Offering.                                              
        17.9.1 NCI code for physical persons                                      
        Physical persons will need an NCI code to participate in a financial market transaction, i.e. a global identification code
        for physical persons. For physical persons with only a Norwegian citizenship, the NCI code is the 11 digit personal ID
        (Nw.: Fødselsnummer). If the person in question has multiple citizenships or another citizenship than Norwegian, another
        relevant NCI code can be used. Investors are encouraged to contact their bank for further information.
        17.9.2 LEI code for legal entities                                        
        Legal entities will need a LEI code to participate in a financial market transaction. A LEI code must be obtained from an
        authorised LEI issuer, which can take some time. Investors should obtain a LEI code in time for the application. For more
        information visit www.gleif.org.                                          
        17.10 Mandatory anti-money laundering procedures                          
        The Offering is subject to applicable anti-money laundering legislation, including the Norwegian Money Laundering Act
        of 1 June 2018 no. 23 and the Norwegian Money Laundering Regulations of 14 September 2018 no. 1324 (collectively,
        the "Anti-Money Laundering Legislation").                                 
        Applicants who are not registered as existing customers of any of the Managers must verify their identity to the Manager
        in which the order is placed in accordance with the requirements of the Anti-Money Laundering Legislation, unless an
        exemption is available. Applicants who have designated an existing Norwegian bank account and an existing VPS account
        on the Retail Application Form, or when registering an application through the VPS online application system, are
        exempted, unless verification of identity is requested by any of the Managers. Applicants who have not completed the
        required verification of identity prior to the expiry of the Application Period may not be allocated Offer Shares.
        17.11 Over-allotment and stabilisation activities                         
        17.11.1 Over-Allotment of Additional Shares                               
        In connection with the Offering, the Managers may elect to over-allot a number of additional Shares equal to up to
        approximately 15% of the total number of New Shares and Sale Shares sold in the Offering. In order to permit delivery
        in respect of over-allotments made, the Managers are expected to be granted the Lending Option, which requires the
                                        117                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        Lending Selling Shareholders on a pro rata basis based on the number of Sale Shares offered to lend to the Stabilization
        Manager, on behalf of the Managers, a number of Shares equal to the number of over-allotted Shares.
                                                                                  
        The Lending Selling Shareholders are expected to grant to the Managers the Over-Allotment Option to subscribe for or
        purchase (on a pro rata basis based on the number of Sale Shares offered), as the case may be, up to 19,155,000
        Additional Shares at the Offer Price, comprising up to approximately 15% of the total number of New Shares and Sale
        Shares sold in the Offering, to cover short positions resulting from any overallotments made in connection with the
        Offering. The Over Allotment Option will be exercisable, in whole or in part, by the Stabilisation Manager, on behalf of
        the Managers, within a 30-day period commencing at the time at which "if issued/if sold" trading in the Shares
        commences on the Oslo Stock Exchange on the terms and subject to the conditions described in this Prospectus. To the
        extent that the Managers have over-allotted Shares in the Offering, the Managers have created a short position in the
        Shares. The Stabilization Manager may close out this short position by buying Shares in the open market through
        stabilization activities and/or by exercising the Over-Allotment Option.  
        A stock exchange notice will be made on the first day of trading in the Shares on an "if issued/if sold" basis on the Oslo
        Stock Exchange (expected to take place on 21 October 2020), announcing whether the Managers have over-allotted
        Shares in connection with the Offering. Any exercise of the Over-Allotment Option will be promptly announced by the
        Stabilisation Manager through the Oslo Stock Exchange's information system.
        17.11.2 Price stabilisation                                               
        The Stabilisation Manager may, from the first day of the Listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange, effect transactions with a
        view to supporting the market price of the Shares at a level higher than what might otherwise prevail, through buying
        Shares in the open market at prices equal to or lower than the Offer Price. There is no obligation on the Stabilization
        Manager to conduct stabilization activities and there is no assurance that stabilization activities will be undertaken. Such
        stabilization activities, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time, and will be brought to an end, at the latest, 30
        calendar days after the time at which "if issued/if sold" trading in the Shares commences on the Oslo Stock Exchange.
        Any stabilisation activities will be conducted in accordance with Section 3-12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act
        and the EC Commission Regulation 2273/2003 regarding buy-back programmes and stabilisation of financial
        instruments.                                                              
        Any loss resulting from such over-allotment or stabilization shall be borne by the Stabilisation Manager, on behalf of the
        Managers. To the extent that there are any profits earned from such stabilisation transactions, the Stabilisation Manager
        shall remit the aggregate amount of any such net profits to (a) the Managers up to an amount equal to reasonable and
        documented costs arising as a result of such stabilization transactions, and (b) any additional profit arising therefrom
        shall be remitted to the Company and the Selling Shareholders on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective
        shares of the total proceeds of the Offering.                             
        Within one week after the expiry of the 30 calendar day period of price stabilization, the Stabilization Manager will publish
        information as to whether or not price stabilization activities were undertaken. If stabilization activities were undertaken,
        the statement will also include information about: (i) the total number of Shares sold and purchased; (ii) the dates on
        which the stabilization period began and ended; (iii) the price range between which stabilization was carried out, as well
        as the highest, lowest and average price paid during the stabilization period; and (iv) the date at which stabilization
        activities last occurred.                                                 
        It should be noted that stabilisation activities might result in market prices that are higher than what would otherwise
        prevail. Stabilisation may be undertaken, but there is no assurance that it will be undertaken and it may be stopped at
        any time.                                                                 
        17.12 Publication of information in respect of the Offering               
        In addition to press releases which will be posted on the Company's website, the Company will use the Oslo Stock
        Exchange's information system to publish information relating to the Offering, such as amendments to the Bookbuilding
        Period and Application Period (if any), the number of Offer Shares, the total amount of the Offering, allocation
        percentages, the first day of conditional trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange and the first day of unconditional trading
        on the Oslo Stock Exchange.                                               
        The final determination of the number of Offer Shares and the total amount of the Offering is expected to be published
        on or about 20 October 2020.                                              
        17.13 The rights conferred by the Offer Shares                            
        The Sale Shares and any Additional Shares will in all respects carry full shareholders' rights in the Company on an equal
        basis as any other existing Shares in the Company, including the right to any dividends. The New Shares will in all
        respects carry full shareholders' rights in the Company on an equal basis as any other Shares in the Company, including
        the right to any dividends, from the date of registration of the share capital increase pertaining to the Offering in the
        Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises (see Section 17.2 "Timetable").
        For a description of rights attached to the Shares in the Company, see Section 13 "Corporate information and description
        of share capital".                                                        
        17.14 VPS registration                                                    
        The Sale Shares and any Additional Shares have been, and the New Shares will be, created under the Norwegian Public

        The Company's register of shareholders with the VPS is administrated by Danske Bank Verdipapirservice Søndre Gate

        17.15 Conditions for completion of the Offering – Listing and trading of the Offer Shares
        The Company will on or around 13 October 2020 apply for listing of its Shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange. It is expected
        that the Oslo Stock Exchange will approve the listing application of the Company on or around 16 October 2020, and
        that such approval will be conditional upon obtaining a minimum of 500 shareholders, each holding Shares with a value
        more than NOK 10,000 and there being a minimum free float of the Shares of 25%. The Company expects that the
        conditions will be fulfilled through the Offering.                        
        Completion of the Offering on the terms set forth in this Prospectus is expressly conditional upon the Oslo Stock Exchange
        approving the application for listing of the Shares on or about 16 October 2020, on conditions acceptable to the Company
        and that any such conditions are satisfied by the Company. The Offering will be cancelled in the event that the conditions
        are not satisfied. There can be no assurance that the Oslo Stock Exchange will give such approval or that the Company
        will satisfy these conditions.                                            
        Completion of the Offering on the terms set forth in this Prospectus is otherwise only conditional upon (i) the Board of
        Directors having resolved to issue the New Shares in the Offering, (ii) the Company and the Principal Shareholder, in
        consultation with the Managers, having approved the allocation of the Offer Shares to eligible investors following the
        bookbuilding process, (iii) the Company, the Selling Shareholders and the Managers having entered into the Purchase
        Agreement (as applicable), (iv) satisfaction of the conditions precedent contained in the Purchase Agreement, and (v)
        the Purchase Agreement not having been terminated in accordance with its terms (see Section 17.1 "Overview of the
        Offering"). There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied. If the conditions are not satisfied, the
        Offering may be revoked or suspended.                                     
        Assuming that the conditions are satisfied, the first day of trading on an "if issued/if sold" basis of the Shares, including
        the Offer Shares, on the Oslo Stock Exchange is expected to be on or about 21 October 2020. The Shares are expected
        to trade under the ticker code "LINK".                                    
        Applicants in the Retail Offering selling Offer Shares prior to delivery must ensure that payment for such Offer Shares is
        made on or prior to the Payment Date, by ensuring that the stated bank account is sufficiently funded on 21 October
        2020. Applicants in the Institutional Offering selling Offer Shares prior to delivery must ensure that payment for such
        Offer Shares is made on or prior to the Institutional Closing Date. Accordingly, an applicant who wishes to sell his/her
        Offer Shares, following confirmed allocation of Offer Shares, but before delivery, must ensure that payment is made in
        order for such Offer Shares to be delivered in time to the applicant.     
        Prior to the Listing and the Offering, the Shares are not listed on any stock exchange or authorized market place, and
        no application has been filed for listing on any other stock exchanges or regulated market places other than Oslo Stock
        Exchange.                                                                 
        17.16 Expenses of the Offering and the Listing                            
        Assuming that the Company raises gross proceeds of NOK 2,500 million from the issuance of the New Shares, the
        Company estimates that expenses in connection with the Offering and the Listing, which will be paid by the Company,
        will amount to approximately NOK 140 million. Accordingly, the net proceeds to the Company will be up to approximately
        NOK 2,360 million. In consideration of the Managers' commitments under the Purchase Agreement, the Company and
        the Selling Shareholders will pay the Managers a fixed base commission calculated on the basis of the gross proceeds
        from the Offering, i.e. the aggregate number of New Shares issued by the Company to be payable by the Company and
        the aggregate number of Sale Shares and, if applicable, any Additional Shares, sold by the Selling Shareholders to be
        payable by the Selling Shareholders. In addition to the above, the Managers may receive a fixed discretionary fee of
        0.5% in connection with the Offering calculated on the basis of the gross proceeds from the Offering determined at the
        Company's and the Principal Shareholder's sole discretion. The payment of the discretionary fee, if any, shall be divided
        between the Company and the Selling Shareholders based on the number of New Shares issued by the Company and
        the number of Offer Shares sold by the Selling Shareholders in the Offering. The estimated expenses above is based on
        the assumption that the variable discretionary fee becomes fully payable. 
        In addition, an IPO bonus of NOK 10 million becomes payable to certain employees and members of the management,
        only subject to successful listing, see Section 12.5 "Bonus program for Management".
        No expenses or taxes will be charged by the Company, the Selling Shareholders or the Managers to the applicants in
        the Offering.                                                             
        17.17 Dilution                                                            
        The issuance of New Shares in the Offering may result in a maximum number of Shares in the Company of 267,398,740,
        which will correspond to a dilution for the existing shareholders of approximately 20%. This is based on the assumption
        that the Company issues the maximum number of New Shares, and that none of the existing Shareholders subscribes
        for any New Shares in the Offering. The existing shareholders' pre-emption rights to subscribe for the New Shares has
        been deviated from, see Section 17.3.                                     
        The net asset value per existing Share as at 30 June 2020 was approximately NOK 11.32.
        17.18 Lock-up

        for the remainder the 180 day period.

        the Company and the Selling Shareholders on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective shares of the total
        proceeds of the Offering.

        18.1  General                                                             
        As a consequence of the following restrictions, prospective investors are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making
        any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of the Shares offered hereby. 
        Other than in Norway, the Company is not taking any action to permit a public offering of the Shares in any jurisdiction.
        Receipt of this Prospectus will not constitute an offer in those jurisdictions in which it would be illegal to make an offer
        and, in those circumstances, this Prospectus is for information only and should not be copied or redistributed. Except as
        otherwise disclosed in this Prospectus, if an investor receives a copy of this Prospectus in any jurisdiction other than
        Norway, the investor may not treat this Prospectus as constituting an invitation or offer to it, nor should the investor in
        any event deal in the Shares, unless, in the relevant jurisdiction, such an invitation or offer could lawfully be made to
        that investor, or the Shares could lawfully be dealt in without contravention of any unfulfilled registration or other legal
        requirements. Accordingly, if an investor receives a copy of this Prospectus, the investor should not distribute or send
        the same, or transfer Shares, to any person or in or into any jurisdiction where to do so would or might contravene local
        securities laws or regulations.                                           
        18.2  Selling restrictions                                                
        18.2.1 United States                                                      
        The Offer Shares have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold,
        directly or indirectly, or otherwise transferred within the United States except: (i) within the United States to investors
        who are reasonably believed to be QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A or pursuant to another available exemption from, or in
        transactions not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act; or (ii) to certain persons in "offshore
        transactions" as defined in, and in compliance with Regulation S, and in accordance with any applicable securities laws
        of any state or territory of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, each Manager has represented and
        agreed that it has not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell, any of the Offer Shares as part of its allocation at any
        time other than to persons reasonably believed to be QIBs in the United States in accordance with Rule 144A or pursuant
        to another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or
        outside of the United States in compliance with Rule 903 of Regulation S. Transfer of the Offer Shares will be restricted
        and each purchaser of the Offer Shares in the United States will be required to make certain acknowledgements,
        representations and agreements, as described under Section 18.3.1 "United States".
        Any offer or sale in the United States will be made solely by affiliates of the Managers who are broker-dealers registered
        under the U.S. Exchange Act. In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, an offer or sale of Offer
        Shares within the United States by a dealer, whether or not participating in the Offering, may violate the registration
        requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A or
        another exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and in connection with any applicable
        state securities laws.                                                    
        18.2.2 United Kingdom                                                     
        Each Manager has severally represented, warranted and agreed that:        
                   it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
                    communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning
                    of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the "FSMA")) received by it in
                    connection with the issue or sale of any Offer Shares in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of
                    the FSMA does not apply to the Company; and                   
                   it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to everything
                    done by it in relation to the Offer Shares in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
        18.2.3 European Economic Area ("EEA")                                     
        In no member state of the EEA and the United Kingdom (each a "Relevant State") have Offer Shares been offered and
        in no Relevant State other than Norway will Offer Shares be offered to the public pursuant to the Offering, except that
        Offer Shares may be offered to the public in that Relevant State at any time in reliance on the following exemptions
        under the EU Prospectus Regulation:                                       
                   to persons who are "qualified investors" within the meaning of Article 2(e) in the EU Prospectus
                    Regulation;                                                   
                   fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the EU
                    Prospectus Regulation) per Relevant State, with the prior written consent of the Managers for any
                    such offer; or                                                
                   in any other circumstances falling under the scope of Article 1(4) of the EU Prospectus Regulation;
        provided that no such offer of Offer Shares shall result in a requirement for the Company or any Manager to publish a
        prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the EU Prospectus Regulation or supplementary prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of
        the EU Prospectus Regulation.                                             
        For the purpose of this provision, the expression an "offer to the public" in relation to any Offer Shares in any Relevant
        State means a communication to persons in any form and by any means presenting sufficient information on the terms
        of the Offering and the Offer Shares to be offered, so as to enable an investor to decide to acquire any Offer Shares.
                                        122

        This EEA selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out in this Prospectus.

        Note 2 – Basis for preparation and significant accounting policies        
                                                                                  
        The consolidated condensed interim financial report for the half-year reporting period ended
        30 June 2020 has been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim
        Financial Reporting.                                                      
                                                                                  
        The interim report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual
        financial report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with Group’s annual report
        for 2019, which has been prepared according to IFRS as adopted by the EU. 
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
        The preparation of interim financial statements requires the Group to make certain estimates
        and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of
        assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated
        by the Group based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future
        events that are deemed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
        from these estimates. The most significant judgements used in preparing these interim
        financial statements and the key areas of estimation uncertainty are the same as those
        applied in the consolidated annual report for 2019.                       
                                                                                  
        The annual report for 2019 provides a description of the uncertainties and potential business
        impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. This extraordinary situation creates risk and affects
        estimates and judgements used in preparing these interim financial statements as its effects
        are unforeseeable and not possible to quantify accurately. The Group has experienced varied
        effects of COVID-19.                                                      
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
        Goodwill and other Intangible assets with an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized
        but are tested annually for impairment. The company performs an impairment test for goodwill
        on an annual basis or when there are circumstances which would indicate that the carrying
        value of goodwill may be impaired. When assessing impairment, assets are grouped into cash
        generating units (CGU’s).                                                 
                                                                                  
        Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are tested by comparing the carrying value
        of goodwill for each CGU to the recoverable amount (enterprise value). The recoverable
        amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use and the impairment
        assessment is built on a discounted cash flow model. At 30 June 2020, such indications have
        been identified as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in the Spanish and
        Bulgarian CGU’s. The COVID-19 pandemic is considered a significant event with potential
        adverse effect on markets and economic environments within our footprint. 
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
        With reference to the the annual report for FY2019 (note 12), calculations use cash flow
        projections approved by management extended over a five-year period. The assumed growth
        rate has been based on the management growth estimate for the next five years and
        subsequently reduced to 3% for the purpose of determining the terminal value. The pre-tax
        discount rates applied to the cash flows are calculated based on the weighted average cost of
        capital (WACC) specific to each CGU and are within the range of 7.1-12.5%.
                                                                                  
        The discounted cash flow performed at 30 June 2020 does not deviate from the methodology
        used at year-end, however the growth estimates specific to Spain and Bulgaria are updated in

        line with the global strategy introduced in 2020. In this way, future cash flow estimates are
        revised; the discount rate used in the half-year assessment is 10%.       
                                                                                  
        Given that estimates and assumptions are more volatile and uncertain, a sensitivity analysis
        has been prepared. The enterprise value for the two CGU’s are still significantly higher than
        the carrying value of the tested goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. The
        calculation identifies sensitivities to changes in EBITDA margins and terminal growth.
        Reductions in EBITDA margins by 4 percentage points and a terminal growth of 1.5
        percentage points would still not indicate any impairment losses.         
                                                                                  
        The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statement is Norwegian kroner (NOK),
                                                                                  
        which is also the functional currency of the parent company. Unless otherwise stated, amounts
        presented are in thousands of NOK.                                        
                                                                                  
        The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated interim financial
        statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual IFRS financial
        statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, except for the estimation of income tax
        and the adoption of new and amended standards as set out below.           
                                                                                  
        IAS 33 Earnings per share and IFRS 8 Operating Segments have been applied in these
        interim financial statements. These standards are not mandatory for entities that do not have
        shares traded in a public market or that file or are in the process of filing financial statements
        with a regulatory organization and have thus not been applied in prior periods. Prior period
        information has been amended to reflect the requirements set out in IAS 33 and IFRS 8.
                                                                                  
        Operating segments are reported in the same manner as internal reporting to the chief
                                                                                  
        operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for
        allocating resources to and assessing performance of operating segments, is defined as the

        Note 3 – Segment reporting                                                
                                                                                  
        The Group reports revenue, gross margin (revenue less direct costs) and adjusted EBITDA in
        functional operating segments to the Board of Directors (the Group’s chief operating decision
        makers). While LINK uses all four measures to analyze performance, the Group’s strategy of
        profitable growth means that adjusted EBITDA is the prevailing measure of performance (refer
        to alternate performance measures).                                       
                                                                                  
        An examination of operating units based on market maturity and product development as well
        as geography identifies four natural reporting segments. These are the Nordics, Western
        Europe, Central Europe, and Global Messaging; these represent market clusters. Generally,
        regions are segregated into similar geographic locations as these follow similar market trends.
        Common routing includes all regions with aggregator traffic; the other three have enterprise
        traffic.                                                                  
                                                                                  
        The regions are:                                                          
        The Nordics                                                               
                                                                                  
        The Nordics is composed of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland.          
        Central Europe                                                            
                                                                                  
        Central Europe is composed of Bulgaria, Romania, North Macedonia, Poland, Hungary,
        Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.                                        
                                                                                  
        Western Europe                                                            
        Western Europe is composed of Spain, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy.
                                                                                  
        Global Messaging                                                          
        Global messaging is comprised of non-enterprise traffic and is representative of either stand-
        alone business or as a component of revenues in countries included above. If a business is
        comprised of both enterprise and wholesale/aggregator transactions, the latter is segregated
        here.                                                                     
                                                                                  
        Wholesale/aggregator business is defined as an operating unit within LINK Mobility’s industry,
        and that use LINK Mobility connections in markets where they do not have such connections
        themselves. This business can generally be referred to, at least partly, as a direct competitor
        that use LINK connections. Smaller local aggregators cannot be expected to be covered
        efficiently by common routing and as such they are still subject to local handling (not a focus
        area though because they are generally low margin and switch easily).

        Victory Partners VIII Norway AS (hereafter “VPAS”) entered into a senior facility agreement on
        27 September 2018 (the "SFA"). The SFA provided VPAS with a EUR 119 million (Facility B -

        capital expenditure facility and a EUR 25 million revolving credit facility for working capital

        Under the terms of the Group’s Senior Facilities Agreement borrowing facilities, the Group is
        required to comply with the financial covenants as described in note 18 to the consolidated
        annual report for 2019 at the respective quarterly test dates.            
                                                                                  
        The first test date of the maintenance covenants was 30 June 2019. The Group has complied
        with these covenants on all test dates including 31 December 2019, 31 March 2020, and 30
                                                                                  
        June 2020. For 31 December 2019 and 31 March 2020, the consolidated total net debt was
        7.03 times LTM consolidated proforma EBITDA including synergies compared to the term of
        loan agreement of 8.50:1 and 11.50:1. For 30 June 2020, the consolidated net debt was 6.84
        time LTM consolidated proforma EBIDTA including synergies compared to the term of loan
        agreement of 8.00:1 and 11.00:1.                                          
                                                                                  
        Collateral                                                                
        In connection with the SFA, Lucid Trustee Services Limited (as security agent under the SFA)
        has been granted certain guarantees and security interests for the benefits of the SFA lenders.
                                                                                  
        These securities include, with some carve-outs and exceptions due to local regulations and
        otherwise pursuant to the agreed security principles set out in the SFA: (i) security over the
        shares in any subsidiary deemed material pursuant to the SFA; (ii) non-blocking charges over
        material bank accounts held by Victory Partners VIII Norway AS (the Company) and any
        subsidiary deemed material pursuant to the SFA; and (iii) security over material intra-group
                                                                                  
        loans between the Company and LINK Mobility Group AS and between the Company and its
        parent company, Victory Partners VIII Norway Holding AS.                  
                                                                                  
        Furthermore, all direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company which is deemed to be a
        material subsidiary (as defined in the SFA) have, or will if such material threshold is met in the
        future, accede to the SFA as guarantors. Each guarantor guarantees the performance of the
        borrowers and the other guarantors’ performance under the SFA on a joint and several basis,
        however subject to any local law restrictions. Additionally, the SFA includes an annual
        guarantor coverage test ensuring that if the guarantors’ consolidated EBITDA is less than 80%
        of the group’s consolidated pro forma EBITDA, additional subsidiaries will have to accede to
        the SFA as guarantors in order to increase the guarantors’ consolidated EBITDA to be above
        the 80% threshold. Such additional acceding subsidiaries must provide collateral as if they
        were deemed a material subsidiary pursuant to the SFA.

        The Group does not have financial liabilities held-for-trading or liabilities designated as at fair
        value through profit or loss. All financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
        The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value as at end of
        each reporting period. Arrangements with financial institutions are entered into on market
        terms, and the carrying value at the reporting date has been assessed as approximating fair
        value.

        Fair value hierarchy levels are based on the extent to which fair values are observable.
                                                                                  
        Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
        markets for identical assets or liabilities.                              
                                                                                  
        Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices
        included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
                                                                                  
        Level 3: fair value measurement are those derived from valuation techniques that include
                                                                                  
        inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
        input).                                                                   
                                                                                  
        Fair value of the arrangements with financial institutions fall within level 3 of the fair value
        hierarchy. The sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs if a

        As at 30 June 2020, certain Group subsidiaries are involved in ongoing legal proceedings as
        either defendant or as plaintiff. The claims for which the Group entities are defendants are
        deemed to be low risk as the majority are covered by guarantees because of acquisitions
        (M&A). The probability of payment is thus considered to be low and no provision has
        been recognized in the financial statements. Due to the uncertain outcome for all these
        ongoing proceedings, no amounts are disclosed as contingent assets or contingent liabilities in
        the notes to the financial statements.

        Note 9 – Events after the reporting period                                
                                                                                  
        On 7 September 2020, the Board resolved to propose that the general meeting of the
        Company adopts a 1:20 share split to be implemented by reducing the nominal value per
        share from NOK 0.10 to NOK 0.005 with the Company's shareholders being allocated 19 new
        shares for each share they own as of the resolution. Subject to the general meeting approving
        such resolution, the share capital of the Company will be NOK 1,082,289.50 divided on
        216,457,900 shares, each with a nominal value of NOK 0.005 and of which 213,874,740 are
        ordinary shares and 2,583,160 are preference shares. The general meeting to resolve the
        above is expected to be held on 15 September 2020.

              Report on Review of Interim Financial Information                   
                                                                                  
              Introduction                                                        
              We have reviewed the accompanying Condensed consolidated statement of financial positions of
              Victory Partners VIII Norway Holding AS as of 30 June 2020, the condensed consolidated income
              statement, the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the condensed
              consolidated statement of changes in equity and the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows
              for the six-month period then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other
              explanatory notes. Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of this interim
              financial information in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
              express a conclusion on this interim financial information based on our review.
              Scope of Review                                                     
                                                                                  
              We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410,
              Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A
              review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible
              for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
              substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on
              Auditing (ISAs), and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware
              of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit
              opinion.                                                            
              Conclusion                                                          
                                                                                  
              Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
              accompanying consolidated interim financial information does not present fairly, in all material
              respects, the financial position of the entity as at 30 June 2020, and its financial performance and its
              cash flows for the six-month period then ended in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial
              Reporting.

        (“APM'S”)                                                                 
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
        The financial information in this report is prepared under International Financial Reporting
        Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU. To enhance the understanding of LINK’s
        performance, the Group presents several alternative performance measures (“APM’s”). An
        APM is defined by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) guidelines as a
        financial measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows,
        other than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting
        framework (IFRS).                                                         
                                                                                  
        Below, LINK presents certain APMs, including gross margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and
        adjusted EBITDA margin. APMs such as EBIT and EBITDA are commonly reported by
        companies in the markets in which LINK competes and are widely used by investors when
        comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to factors such as depreciation
        and amortization, which can vary significantly, depending upon accounting methods
        (particularly when acquisitions have occurred) or based on non-operating factors.
        LINK uses the following APMs:                                             
                                                                                  
        EBIT                                                                      
        EBIT means earnings before interest and taxes. EBIT is a performance measure applied to
        express profitability of operating activities; EBIT is presented in note 3 Segment reporting.
                                                                                  
        EBITDA                                                                    
        EBITDA means earnings before interest, taxes, amortization, depreciation, and impairments.
        LINK has presented EBITDA in the consolidated statement of profit and loss because
        management believes that the measure provides useful information regarding the Group’s
        ability to service debt and to fund capital expenditures and provides a helpful measure for
        comparing its operating performance with that of other companies.         
                                                                                  
        Adjusted EBITDA                                                           
        Adjusted EBITDA means EBITDA adjusted by expenses related to significant one-time, non-
        recurring events such as acquisitions and restructuring activities, legal advisors, and share-
        based compensation. LINK has presented adjusted EBITDA in the consolidated statement of
        profit and loss because management believes the measure provides useful information
        regarding operating performance.

          Market – position and development                                       
          The overall market trend towards “one to one communication” continues with the expansion of
          messaging channels and deeper personalization and continues the expansion of notification use-
          cases. OTT and RCS channels are being progressively established as supplementary channels
          to the core SMS messaging channel. The total market for A2P (application to person) mobile
          services experienced healthy growth in 2019 and the trend of businesses using mobile platforms
          as a key part of their communication strategy continued.                
                                                                                  
          The Nordic and the French markets are regarded as advanced in terms of seeking and adopting
          mobile services and technologies; these markets are a few years ahead of counterparts in other
                                                                                  
          markets when it comes to taking mobile messaging solutions into use. LINK has a comparative
          advantage when entering new markets based on its long experience with messaging services
          combined with advanced technological platforms and solid reference cases. This enables LINK to
          expand the market potential when entering new geographical markets.     
                                                                                  
          In 2019, LINK sent 9.7 billion messages (including the full year effect of acquired entities) on
          behalf of its more than 30.000 customers. LINK is regularly delivering mobile messages to most
          mobile users in its main markets.                                       
                                                                                  
          LINK continues to experience a high degree of recurring revenue from existing clients and an
          expansion of use-cases combined with increased revenue per customer as most customers
          increase their use of LINK’s mobile services. With LINK’s mobile services, customers increased
          their revenue through efficient communication with their end users and at the same time, reduced
          costs by running more efficient internal processes. LINK is experiencing an increased demand for
          mobile solutions such as conversational messaging and pre-defined client dialogue flows as well
                                                                                  
          as new channels to allow customers to reach end users via Facebook Messenger, What’s app
          and Viber. This will enable further expansion and improve the use-case. 
                                                                                  
          The market for mobile messaging and mobile solutions is expected to continue to experience
          growth over the coming years as more and more private companies, public services and
          organizations recognize the importance of offering their customers and users mobile
          communication and services. LINK has a clear strategy of continuing the growth by increasing its
          market share in existing markets and by entering new markets both within and possibly outside
          the current footprint in Europe. This is to be obtained through a combination of organic growth
          and acquisitions. The experience from the Nordics and French markets for developing and
          deploying state of the art mobile solutions are amongst the most innovative in the world. LINK
          capitalizes on this knowledge when accessing and expanding into new, less developed markets.

          Risks                                                                   
          The Group has identified three types of risks that can prevent successful implementation of its
          business strategy or manage its growth effectively: market risk, financial risk, and acquisition risk.
                                                                                  
          The below section describes how the Group evaluates and mitigates these risks and includes a
          brief comment to the risk related to the Covid-19 virus.                
                                                                                  
          Market risk                                                             
          LINK’s market share for A2P mobile services have grown rapidly over time through both organic
          growth and through acquisitions and benefits from a unique competitive position. LINK is by far
          the largest player in Europe within its industry resulting in economies of scale relating to capacity
          and competences for developing and launching new products, broad existing product offerings
          and solid expertise in operations and system integrations towards customers.
                                                                                  
          Based on market and competitive advantages, LINK builds long-term customer relationships
                                                                                  
          through high quality of services, system integration and development of new products and
          solutions. LINK has very low customer churn in all markets as customers who have first started
          using mobile communications in one area, tend to move more and more business activities to
          mobile platforms increasing integration and reliability on LINK.        
                                                                                  
          LINK’s revenue, costs and profits are subjected to the risk of changes in customer prices. As the
          market is expanding, margin pressure is observed and anticipated in some parts of the market.
          The price pressure is likely to be focused on low-value wholesale/bulk SMS and basic mobile
          payment services. LINK will therefore continue its strategy of delivering value added services to
          its customers through new innovative solutions such as conversational messaging and channel
          agnostic solutions improving the mobile messaging use case. LINK’s broad specter of mobile
          services enables a customer offering that is complete and covering multiple needs. This creates
          high customer satisfaction and creates close relationships between LINK and its customers. As
          the use case expands, LINK address smaller and medium sized customers which typically have a
          higher price point per message. These factors reduce the overall price risk. Expanding towards a
                                                                                  
          channel-agnostic messaging solution will contribute to reducing message delivery cost by utilizing
          more IP based protocols and hence improving and protecting gross margin.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Financial risk                                                          
          The Group’s activities expose it to financial risks, such as price, currency, liquidity, interest rate
          and credit. Overall, these risks are regarded as low and manageable.    
                                                                                  
          By being the leading provider and thus the largest buyers of SMS in its markets, LINK can
          purchase SMS from the telecom operators at favorable prices. Additionally, LINK’s position
          ensures priority from the operators securing high quality in terms of delivery reliability.
                                                                                  
          LINK’s subsidiaries operate using their local currencies (NOK, SEK, DKK, PLN, BGN, HUF, GBP,
          MKD, RON, and EUR). Revenue and cost transactions are usually carried out in the same
                                                                                  
          currency, which reduces the currency risk, however Victory and LINK present annual reports in
          NOK and changes in the underlying currencies in relation to NOK impact the overall revenue and
          financial position in the presentation currency.                        
                                                                                  
          LINK is also exposed to exchange risk regarding the EUR share of its Senior Facility Agreement
          (loan), Capex Facility and Revolving Facility in EUR.

          Victory considers its liquidity risk to be limited and has sufficient liquidity available on bank
          accounts and through the established Revolving Facility as of year-end 2019.
                                                                                  
          Victory Partner VIII Norway AS established a Senior Facility Agreement in September 2018
          Pursuant to the SFA, the Company has undertaken to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio
          (consolidated total net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA) below certain thresholds set out in
          the SFA’s leverage ratio tables. The leverage ratio undertaking shall be tested quarterly, and the
          VIctory Partners VIII Norway AS’s consolidated ratios shall be below the threshold for the
          applicable testing date set out in the SFA. The leverage ratio testing was performed at the end of
          each quarter starting from 30 June 2019. At all test dates the leverage ratio meets with the
          criteria’s set out in the SFA.                                          
                                                                                  
          LINK had marginal losses on trade receivables in 2019 and has established efficient routines for
                                                                                  
          the handling of overdue trade receivables across its footprint.         
                                                                                  
          Management of financial risk is performed with the emphasis on keeping the financial risk at a
          minimum, and the main principle is to minimize exposure to financial risk. There are no financial
          assets or liabilities held for speculative purposes.

          The strategy of acquiring new businesses will require the successful purchase of suitable
          companies at sound multiples, and that integration of acquired companies is managed to realize
          synergies through scale advantages. The results of the prior year’s acquisitions confirm that
          management has such expertise. During 2019, the organizational structure and key functions
          were further developed and restructured to ensure even more efficient integration of new
          businesses.

          The coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) continues to spread across the world and have led to
          numerous Government imposed restrictions and lockdowns across the Groups footprint. The
          duration of such measures is uncertain and represents a significant uncertainty on the future
                                                                                  
          economic outlook which cannot be predicted.                             
                                                                                  
          At the date of this report, the Group has taken measures to ensure the safety of its employees in
          compliance with local regulations and a crisis organization have been established.
          Considering the potential risk of significant lower messaging volumes, lower growth rate and
          increased credit risk the Group has already implemented measures to reduce administrative
          expenses and personnel cost to mitigate the reduction in revenue and gross margin already
          observed in some markets. Other measures implemented includes tightened credit and collection
          procedures as well as vendor negotiations to improve payment terms and risk sharing related to
          shortfall on client payments.                                           
          The Groups diversified portfolio of companies across Europe and mix of customers is expected to
          be an valuable asset as the need to communicate is essential for both Governments and private
          businesses during the crisis partly and will help mitigate effects lower mobile marketing volumes.

          LINK’s workforce, coupled with its technology, is the most important asset both in terms of
          serving LINK’s customers of today and for the future development of the company. To strengthen
          innovation and development capacity, LINK has established a development hub in Bulgaria with
          46 employees at the end of 2019. LINK has also strengthened strategic functions within the
          finance, legal, project management, and sales and technology departments by reorganizing
          existing competences and recruiting new employees. Regional segments have also been
          restructured to maximize synergies.
