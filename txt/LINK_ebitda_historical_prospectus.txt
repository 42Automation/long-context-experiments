                   (a)   Acquisition Revenue is defined as revenue generated by the acquired entities for the periods indicated. The Company
                         considers Acquisition Revenue any revenue generated by acquired entities for four full consecutive quarters after
                         complete ownership by the Company of such entity. From 1 January 2018 an acquired Spanish entity was merged
                         with an existing entity, hence the allocation of revenues between organic and acquired revenue is based on a
                         management estimate. In 2017 an acquired Danish entity was merged with an existing Danish entity, hence the
                         allocation between organic and acquired revenue is estimated. See Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions".
                   (b)   When comparing the Like-for-Like Revenue for a relevant period, the entities used for such calculation differ from
                         period to period, as the Company excludes revenues from companies acquired during the relevant periods in
                         calculating Like-for-Like Revenue. This methodology allows the Company to isolate and compare the revenue
                         generated by the companies that were operating for the full relevant period compared. See Section 11.3.2
                         "Acquisitions".
                         When comparing the years ended 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2019, the Company excludes revenues from
                         companies acquired in 2019 and 2018, but includes the revenue from companies acquired in 2017, as the Company
                         no longer considers such revenue as Acquisition Revenue. The growth rate of Like-for-Like Revenue for the years
                         ended 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2019 increased from 1,956.9 to 2,128.7, an increase of 9%.
                         When comparing the years ended 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2018, the Company excludes revenues from
                         companies acquired in 2017 and 2018. The growth rate of Like-for-Like Revenue for the years ended 31 December
                         2017 to 31 December 2018 increased from 1,255.4 to 1,387.9, an increase of 11%.
           6   Gross Profit Conversion is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Gross Profit.
           7   Revenue Net Retention Rate is defined as revenue from the net of upsale, downsale and churn for customers throughout the period, not
               taking into account new customers during the year. Revenue Net Retention Rate excludes the acquisitions of TeraComm Group and Spothit.
               Excluding Spain, these figures are 116% and 111% for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and as of 31 December 2020, respectively. The
               data required to calculate these measures was not yet monitored in the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 and as a result
               comparatives for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 are not available.
           8   Churn Rate is defined as revenue of customers that were a customer in the prior period but were not a customer at the beginning of the
               current period divided by the total revenue of the prior period. The data required to calculate these measures was not yet monitored in the
               years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 and as a result comparatives for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 are not available.
           9   Net Customer Expansion Rate is defined as the revenue generated from customers at the end of the period with their corresponding revenue
               from the same period in the previous year.
