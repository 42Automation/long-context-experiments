            LINK has been operating in the digital messaging industry for two decades. The company was
            founded in Norway in 2001, when short message service (SMS) from person-to-person (P2P)
            was well established, while application-to-person (A2P) SMS was new. LINK developed the
            A2P market in Norway throughout the 2000s, which today is the most mature and advanced
            messaging market in the world.                                        
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            From its foothold in Norway, LINK first expanded in Scandinavia and then beyond with the
            acquisition of Whatever Mobile in Germany in 2016. Since 2016, LINK has completed more
            than 20 acquisitions across Europe and the company is now the market leader in mobile
            digital messaging on the continent.                                   
                                                                                  
            A2P messaging is an application that sends thousands or millions of one-way messages from
                                                                                  
            an enterprise or government entity to customers or citizens. Mobile users will recognize both
            notifications and marketing types of messages. The importance of digital messaging has
            naturally grown with the increased penetration of mobile phones, as A2P messaging utilizes
            the telecom networks. LINK will orchestrate the messages form enterprises or governments
            and send them through all relevant telecom operator networks to the end users. The telecom
            operators are thus channel suppliers to LINK.                         
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            Until the shift from mobile phones to smart phones, telecom networks was the only digital
            messaging channel. However, with the rise of new internet-based apps there are now a
            multitude of new possibilities. WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Viber and many
            other over-the-top (OTT) channels are now the preferred way to communicate for many
            people. OTT refers to internet streamed content, historically devices that go “over-the-top” of
            the cable TV box.

            These new channels provide vast new opportunities for digital communication, but also
            greatly increases complexity. Orchestration is no longer just between telecom operators,
            but in addition the multitude of new internet-based channels. This shift has given rise to a
            new industry, communication-platform-as-a-service (CPaaS), to manage the complexity and
            facilitate for the opportunities these new technologies present.      
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            Whilst standard SMS is limited to 160 signs in black and white, the new OTT channels have
            no such limitations. SMS is also evolving to SMS 2.0 or rich communication services (RCS),
            which is being adopted in several European countries. RCS can offer similar features to the
            new OTT channels, but is distributed over the telecom networks.       
                                                                                  
            Digital messages will become much more colourful and interesting with the new mediums.
                                                                                  
            Richer content gives more user engagement. Engaged customers are more loyal and
            enterprises increasingly see the importance of investing in digital messaging solutions. As the
            chart below illustrates, the CPaaS market is expected to triple over the coming years.
                                                                                  
            Although the new and colourful RCS and OTT channels are still small in volumes, A2P
            messaging has already evolved to solutions. In mature markets like Norway, A2P messages
                                                                                  
            include a link to a landing page with rich content. Advanced digital messaging solutions are
            therefor already more widespread than the low RCS and OTT volumes would indicate. The
            new technologies will however make the experiences more seamless and establish two-
            way messaging or digital conversations as the standard for enterprises and governments to
            interact with customers and citizens.

            The mobile communications industry is exposed to rapid technological changes that may be
                                                                                  
            accelerated by increased focus on sustainability. LINK strives to contribute to the development of
            more sustainable technologies, which will be positive for the environment and give the company
            a competitive advantage. LINK develops software for digital messaging solutions which enable
            smartphone notifications and marketing services. Notifications facilitate for online distribution,
            making it easy for customers to track orders and delivery times. Digital notifications also lessen
            the need for paper-based mail systems in relation to appointments and confirmations. Digital
            marketing engages customers seamlessly through to purchase on their smartphones, freeing up
            time and reducing pollution related to transportation. In addition to this, we see traction for two
            products that will reduce paper consumption:

            LINK contributes to reduced carbon emissions by prioritizing video conferencing to travel. LINK
            started with group-wide meetings for all employees in 17 countries well before the pandemic. All
            subsidiaries are further encouraged to consider the environmental impact of its activities and to
            implement processes to reduce their environmental footprint.

            LINK can influence energy consumption through choice of server sites and hosting providers.
            By only working with established suppliers and requiring documented energy efficiencies, LINK
            contributes to reduced consumption. LINK will enhance its due diligence processes related to
            procurement in 2021. The company operates in several countries and continuously assesses
            opportunities to optimize the use of or merger of server sites to further minimize energy
            consumption.

            LINK’s suppliers might be affected by issues resulting from climate change, hereunder flooding and
            loss of power. Risks are mitigated through server site redundancies and working with established
            hosting providers that can document backup and continuity routines.

            The composition of the Board must ensure that it can attend to the common interests of all
            shareholders and meet the needs of the company. The Board of Directors of LINK has adopted
                                                                                  
            the LINK Corporate Governance Policy to reflect the company’s commitment to good corporate
            governance. Through good governance of the business, the company intends to create
            profitability and increased shareholder value. For specifics on the Board and its governance
            work, please refer to the “Report form the Board of Directors” section later in this report.
                                                                                  
            Corruption                                                            
                                                                                  
            Corruption undermines any legitimate business operation. Bribery and corruption are therefore
            a risk for any sustainable business. LINK will enhance its due diligence processes related to
            procurement in 2021. LINK’s approach to corruption is fully described in the LINK Anti-Bribery
            and Anti-Corruption Policy.

            LINK complies with all applicable antitrust laws and managers are required to take action to
            avoid even the appearance of any wrongdoing. All LINK employees must demonstrate their
            awareness of antitrust laws when engaging with competitors, customers, resellers, partners,
            distributors or suppliers and seek further guidance from the LINK’s Legal Function when in
            doubt. LINK’s approach to competition is fully described in the LINK Anti-Trust Policy.

            To ensure implementation of and compliance with ESG policies, LINK follows the compliance
            standard ISO19600. External and internal issues of relevance to compliance have been
            assessed by the compliance function since its establishment in 2019 and with mandate given
                                                                                  
            by the Global Leadership Team (GLT). From 2020, compliance is part of LINK’s long-term
            strategy and the approval of main policies has consequently been lifted to the Board level.
                                                                                  
            The boundaries for the compliance management system (CMS) are set out in the compliance
            team mandate. Unless otherwise instructed by GLT for specific projects, the compliance
            function will cover the LINK group organization and systems. LINK subsidiaries will be
            accountable for compliance in their organizations, with support from the group compliance

            LINK has 20 years of experience in providing mobile messaging services and mobile solutions
            for companies, public services and organizations. After several years of expansion, LINK is
            now the leader within mobile messaging and solutions in Europe. From this footprint, LINK is
            uniquely positioned to benefit from increased usage of mobile solutions within Europe and to
            expand beyond Europe.

            The overall market trend towards digital conversations continues with new messaging channels
            offering more scope for personalization. New RCS (SMS 2.0) and OTT (internet streaming)
            channels are increasingly an addition to the core SMS product, supporting the growth of CPaaS
            solutions. The total market for digital messaging continued to grow in 2020 as more private
            companies, public services and organizations used mobile platforms and solutions as a central
            part of their communication strategy. In 2020 (2019), LINK sent 10.7 billion messages (9.7)
            (including the full year effect of acquired entities) on behalf of its 40.600 (31.800) customers.
                                                                                  
            The market for mobile messaging solutions is expected to continue to grow strongly over
            the coming years with vast opportunities presented by the new CPaaS technologies. LINK is
            experiencing increased demand for more advanced mobile solutions such as conversational
            messaging including new channels like WhatsApp and Viber. The Nordics and the French
            market are among the most innovative in the world when it comes to adopting digital mobile
            solutions and technologies. LINK has decades long experience in the Nordics and has in recent
            years leveraged its knowledge and capabilities in France and other European markets.
                                                                                  
            LINK continues to experience a high degree of recurring revenue from existing clients and
            an expansion of use cases combined with increased revenue per customer. Most customers
            increase their use of LINK’s mobile services and include more advanced solutions. LINK’s
            customers realise high returns-on-investment (ROI) through both higher revenue from better
            communication with their end users and lower costs with more efficient internal processes.
                                                                                  
            LINK has a clearly stated twofold strategy for continued growth. The company aims to drive
            organic growth by increasing its market share in existing markets and to enter new markets
            through acquisitions. Increased organic growth is supported by LINK’s threefold go-to-market
            (GTM) strategy.

            (Figures in brackets refer to balance 31 December 2020, unless otherwise specified)
            As of 31 December 2020, LINK’s total assets amounted to NOK 7 700 million (NOK 6 071
            million), of which intangible assets were NOK 5 806 million (NOK 5 152 million). Intangible
                                                                                  
            assets are mainly comprised of goodwill equal to NOK 3 983 million (NOK 3 390 million). Trade
            receivables and other receivables amounted to NOK 749 million (NOK 668 million) and cash
            and cash equivalents to NOK 952 million (NOK 147 million).            
            Total equity was NOK 4 304 (NOK 2 340 million) and constituted of NOK 1 million in share
            capital, a share premium of NOK 4 883 million and NOK 580 million in accumulated losses and

            Long-term liabilities were NOK 2 425 million (NOK 2 847 million) and consisted mainly of the
            5-year EUR 200 million bond issued in December 2020.                  
                                                                                  
            LINK’s cash flow from operating activities during 2020 was NOK 364 million (NOK 198 million).
                                                                                  
            Cash flow from investing activities were a negative NOK 660 million (negative NOK 434 million).
            Main elements were the acquisition of WebSMS in November 2020 and a payment of an
            earn-out related to the Netsize acquisition in 2019.                  
                                                                                  
            Cash flows from financing activities amounted to NOK 1 135 million (NOK 215 million),
            stemming from the recapitalization and refinancing of LINK through the IPO in October 2020
            and the bond issuance in December 2020.

            The Group has identified three types of risks that can prevent successful implementation
            of its business strategy or manage its growth effectively. Market risk, financial risk and
            acquisition risk. The Global Leadership Team (GLT) is responsible for risk management at
            LINK. The below section describes how GLT evaluates and mitigates these risks and includes
            a comment to the risks related to the global pandemic.

            LINK’s market share for A2P mobile services and more advanced CPaaS solutions have grown
            rapidly over time through both organic growth and acquisitions and the company now benefits
            from a unique competitive position. Extensive market experience gives LINK a competitive
            advantage in building long-term customer relationships based on high quality services, system
            integrations and development of new products and solutions. This results in a very low
            customer churn and recurring revenue for LINK.

            LINK’s revenue, costs and profits are subjected to the risk of changes in customer and
            supplier prices. As the market is expanding, margin pressure is observed and anticipated for
            some products. The price pressure is likely to be focused on low-value wholesale/bulk SMS
            and basic mobile payment services. LINK will hence continue its strategy of delivering high
            value-added services to its enterprise customers through new innovative CPaaS solutions,
            leveraging its expertise to protect and increase margins.             
                                                                                  
            LINK’s channel-agnostic messaging solutions could benefit from reduced message delivery
            costs over time. The growth in OTT channels alongside the traditional telecom operator
            networks is likely to lead to competition between channel providers for messaging volume.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            Financial risk                                                        
            LINK’s activities expose it to financial risks, such as price, currency, liquidity, interest rate and
            credit. Overall, these risks are regarded as low and manageable.      
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            By being the leading provider and thus the largest buyer of SMS in its markets, LINK can
            purchase SMS from the telecom operators at favorable prices. Additionally, LINK’s position
            ensures priority from the operators, which secures high quality in terms of deliverability.
                                                                                  
            LINK’s subsidiaries operate using their local currencies. Revenue and cost transactions are
            usually carried out in the same currency. This natural hedge reduces the currency risk and
                                                                                  
            protects margins. There is however a translation effect to LINK’s reporting currency NOK as
            changes in NOK to underlying currencies will impact reported figures. LINK is also exposed
            to exchange rate risk in relation to its 5-year EUR 200 million outstanding bond issued on
            15 December 2020. The bond has a EUR 350 million borrowing limit and a fixed coupon of
            3.375% p.a. LINK’s significant cash flow exposure to EUR lessens this foreign exchange (FX)
            risk. LINK has applied for the bond to be listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            LINK considers its liquidity risk to be limited and has sufficient liquidity available on bank
            accounts and through established facilities as of year-end 2020. LINK had marginal losses on
            trade receivables in 2020 and has established efficient routines for the handling of overdue
            trade receivables across its footprint.                               
                                                                                  
            Management of financial risk is performed with the emphasis on keeping the financial risk

            that management has such expertise. During 2020, the organizational structure and key

            The coronavirus pandemic continues to be a challenge across the world and has led to
            numerous government restrictions and lockdowns across LINK’s footprint. The duration of
            such measures is uncertain and represents a significant uncertainty on the future economic
            outlook which cannot be predicted. However, the successful discovery of several vaccines and
                                                                                  
            mass vaccinations in many countries give hope for a gradual return of activity throughout 2021.
            At the date of this report, LINK has taken measures to ensure the safety of its employees in
            compliance with local regulations and a crisis organization was established last year.
            LINK’s diversified portfolio of companies across Europe and mix of customers is a valuable
            asset as the need to communicate is essential for both governments and private businesses
            during the pandemic and will help to reduce the effect from lower mobile marketing volumes.
            Longer-term the pandemic is likely to have accelerated the secular digitalization trend with
            numerous new use cases created during 2020.

            local entities depending on requirements. Internal annual audits are performed for compliance
            with GDPR. Policies are accessible to employees in LINK Intranet, and training is provided or
            planned depending on area.

            LINK is benefitting from strong market trends with an accelerated demand for advanced
            CpaaS solutions and products. As LINK invest more in additional go-to-market (GTM)
            initiatives and launch new products in the current footprint, LINK expect demand for our
            products to grow even further. LINK also has strong momentum on M&A processes and
            observes increased M&A activity in a highly fragmented industry. The strength in these

            The main assumptions behind the guidance are a gradual increase in organic growth to 20% in
            the mid to long-term with the effects from the GTM initiatives and margin expansion driven by
            the operating leverage inherent in LINK’s scalable business model. The tailwinds from strong
            market trends and uplift in new products and channels will increase organic revenue growth and
            LINK expects a gradual increase in number of messages and revenues growth through 2021
            from current levels. While quarterly variations due to lockdowns and government restrictions
                                                                                  
            make forecasting with LINK’s typical level of precision somewhat more difficult, LINK expect an
            increased level of underlying growth during 2021 as compared to 2020, which is likely to be the
            year most significantly impacted by the pandemic.

         affected the amounts reported, presentation and disclosures in these financial statements.

                                                            commencing on         
         Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations October 2018 01 January 2020   
                                                                                  
         As at the date of authorisation of these financial statements; new Standards and Interpretations have been issued
         by the IASB but were not effective for the financial year ended 31 December 2020.
                                                                                  
         Management anticipates that these Standards and Interpretations will be adopted in the Group’s financial
         statements for the period beginning 01 January 2021 or later. Management has not yet considred the extent of the
         potential impact of the adoption of these new and revised/amended Standards and Interpretations.

         3.1 General information                                                  
         LINK Mobility Group Holding ASA (“the Company”) is a limited liability Company incorporated and domiciled in
         Norway. The address of the registered office is Langkaia 1 – Havnelageret, 0150 Oslo, Norway. LINK Mobility Group
         Holding ASA is the parent company of the LINK Mobility Pecunia AS, which in turn is the parent company of LINK
         Mobility Group AS (“the Group”). The Group provides services in mobile communication and specialises in mobile
         messaging services, mobile solutions and mobile intelligence.            
         These consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on date 26 April 2021.
         Minor rounding differences may be present and the total may deviate from the total of the individual amounts. This
         is due to the rounding of whole figures to thousands for presentation purposes.
                                                                                  
         3.2 Basis for preparation                                                
         The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
         Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the
         European Union. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
                                                                                  
         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting
         estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgments in applying the Group’s accounting policies. Areas
         involving a high degree of judgment or complexity, and areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant to
         the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 4 (critical accounting judgements and key sources of
         estimation variances). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis.
         The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statement is Norwegian kroner (NOK), which is also the
         functional currency of the parent company.                               
                                                                                  
         3.3 Principles of consolidation                                          
         The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries,
         which are entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when the Group has power over the investee, is
         exposed, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power
         to affect its returns. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate
         that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control noted above. The financial statements of the
         subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting periods as the parent company and consistent accounting policies
         are applied. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement
         from the date when control is obtained and until control ceases, respectively. Intercompany transactions, balances,
         revenues, expenses and unrealised Group internal gains or losses are eliminated on consolidation.
         When the group ceases to consolidate an investee because of a loss of control, any retained interest in the entity is
         remeasured to its fair value with the change in the carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value of the
         retained interest becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the investment.
                                                                                  
         3.4 Business combinations                                                
         Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred and all the
         identifiable assets and liabilities of acquired entities are measured at fair values at the date of acquisition, except
         deferred tax assets or liabilities and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements, which are
         recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively.
         Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

         Goodwill is measured at the amount by which the total consideration transferred exceeds the net fair value of assets
         acquired. Goodwill is not amortised, but its value is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when
         there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, may be impaired. Goodwill
         is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash generating units) that is expected to
         benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its
         carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any
         impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is
         not reversed in subsequent periods.                                      
                                                                                  
         When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes contingent consideration
         arrangements, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of
         the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration
         that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments
         recognised in goodwill. Measurement period adjustments arise from additional information obtained during the
         ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances
         that existed at the acquisition date. The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent
         consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration
         is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates
         and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Other contingent consideration is remeasured to fair
         value at subsequent reporting dates with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
                                                                                  
         If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the
         combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
         Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see above), or additional assets or
         liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the
         acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
                                                                                  
         On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination
         of the profit or loss on disposal.                                       
                                                                                  
         3.5 Revenue recognition                                                  
         Revenues are recognised when services are rendered and measured based on the consideration to which the Group
         expects to be entitled in a contract with a customer net of discounts and sales related taxes. The Group recognises
         revenue when it transfers control of a product or service to a customer. 
                                                                                  
         When the Group is acting as an agent, amounts are collected on behalf of the principal. In order to determine
         whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent, the risks and rewards associated with the service in question
         are assessed. When the Group is acting as an agent, amounts are collected on behalf on the principal. In order to
         determine whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent, the Group assesses whether the Group controls the
         service before it is provided to the customer. Where the Group does not control the service, the Group is considered
         an agent in the transaction.

         Revenues primarily comprise sale of services that enable customers to communicate by mobile phone with their
         customers. In order to be able to render these services, the Group needs to obtain services from one or more
         telecommunication operators.                                             
                                                                                  
         The services rendered are split into the following groups:

         3.6 Foreign currency translation                                         
         In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s
         functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
         transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies
         are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated
         in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-
         monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated after the
         transaction date.                                                        
         Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the
         income statement as financial items. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented on a net basis in the
         income statement as other operating expenses. Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in
         which they arise.                                                        
                                                                                  
         For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign
         operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are
         translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that
         period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any,
         are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity.
         Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are considered as assets and
         liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. These exchange differences are recognised in other
         comprehensive income.                                                    
                                                                                  
         On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation), or a
         disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, all of the exchange differences
         accumulated in a separate component of equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the
         company are reclassified to profit or loss. In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes
         a foreign operation that does not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share of
         accumulated exchange differences is re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in profit or

         Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised initially as set out in 3.4 Business
         Combinations above.                                                      
         Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing,
         goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) expected
         to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are
         tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the
         recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is
         allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of
         the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for
         goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. On disposal of a cash generating unit, the attributable amount of
         goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
                                                                                  
         Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are recognised
         initially at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).

         Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less
         accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis
         over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each
         reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible
         assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
         Separately acquired intangible assets                                    
         Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation
         and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent to initial recognition, separately acquired intangible assets are
         reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible
         assets that are acquired in a business combination.                      
                                                                                  
         Internally generated intangible assets – technology                      
         Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally-
         generated intangible asset arising from development of the Groups technical platforms and products is recognised if,
         and only if, all the following conditions have been demonstrated:        
         y the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
         y the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;     
                                                                                  
         y the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;                       
         y how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
         y the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell
          the intangible asset; and                                               
         y the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
         The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from
         the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally generated
         intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is
         incurred.                                                                
                                                                                  
         Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated
         amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired in a
         business combination.                                                    
         3.8 Equipment and fixtures                                               
         Equipment and fixtures are initially recognised at cost, which includes the purchase price (including duties and non-
         refundable purchase taxes) and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition
         necessary for it to be able to operate in the intended manner. Equipment and fixtures are subsequently recognised at
         cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is recognised so as to
         reduce the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method. Depreciation
         commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.              
                                                                                  
         Estimated useful life, depreciation method and residual values are reviewed at least annually. The straight-line
         depreciation method is used as this best reflects the consumption of the assets, which often is the passage of time.
         Residual value is estimated to be zero for all assets.                   
                                                                                  
         Repair and maintenance is expensed as incurred. If new parts are capitalised, replaced parts are derecognised and
         any remaining net carrying amount is recognised in operating profit (loss) as loss on disposal.
         An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are

         expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an
         item of equipment and fixtures is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount
         of the asset and is presented as other income or other expenses in the income statement.
                                                                                  
         3.9 Impairment of non-financial assets                                   
         At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to
         determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication
         exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
         Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the
         recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis
         of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise
         they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation
         basis can be identified.                                                 
                                                                                  
         Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever
         there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.                   
         Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
         estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
         market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future
         cash flows have not been adjusted.                                       
                                                                                  
         If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
         carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
         recognised immediately in profit or loss.                                
                                                                                  
         Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is
         increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not
         exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset
         (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss,
         unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated
         as a revaluation increase. Any impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
                                                                                  
         3.10 IFRS 16 Leases                                                      
         The Group initially applied IFRS 16 from 01 January 2019; IFRS 16 is applied using the modified retrospective
         approach. When applying the modified retrospective method, a lessee measures the right-of-use asset at either
         its carrying amount as if IFRS 16 had always been applied since the commencement date (discounted using the
         incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application), or at an amount equal to the lease liability (adjusted for
         previously recognised prepaid or accrued lease payments). The choice between the two options shall be made on a
         lease-by-lease basis.                                                    
                                                                                  
         The Group has chosen to measure the right-of-use asset at an amount equal to the lease liability for all leases by
         using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate; the rate may differ from country to country.
                                                                                  
         The lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a

         The Group used a number of practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously classified as operating
         leases under IAS 17. Specifically, the Group:                            
         y did not recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with a lease term that ends within 12 months from the
                                                                                  
          date of application;                                                    
         y did not recognise right-of-use assets anf liabilities for leases of low value assets;
         y excluded initial dirct cost from the measurement of the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application; and
         y used hindsight when determining the lease term.                        
         The Group has elected to use the exemptions in the standard on short-term lease contracts and for lease contracts
         where the underlying asset is of low value. These leases are recognised as operation expenses in the profit and loss.
                                                                                  
         3.11 Government grants                                                   
         The Group receives Government grant as part of the “Skattefunn” arrangement in Norway, which is an arrangement
         to stimulate research and development in Norway. The government grant is initially recognised as a deduction to the
         carrying amount of the relevant asset. The amount is subsequently credited to profit or loss on a straight-line basis
         over the estimated useful life of the related asset.                     
                                                                                  
         3.12 Financial Instruments                                               
         Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly
         attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and
         financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial
         assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. 
                                                                                  
         The categorisation of financial instruments (financial assets and liabilities) for measurement purposes is based
         on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument and is determined on initial recognition. The Group presents
         financial assets and liabilities in the following classes: trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade
         and other payables, long term borrowings and short-term borrowings.      
                                                                                  
         Financial assets                                                         
         The financial assets held by the group, primarily trade and other receivables, are held within a business model whose
         objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and are thus measured subsequently at
         amortised cost less loss allowances. The impairment model in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments requires the recognition
         of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses (ECL). The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected
         credit losses on trade receivables. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect
         changes in credit risk since initial recognition. The impairment is calculated by taking into account the historic
         evidence of the level of credit losses experienced and the ageing profile of the trade receivables. Individual trade
         receivables are impaired when management assesses them not to be wholly or partially collectible.
         Financial liabilities                                                    
         The Group does not have financial liabilities held-for-trading or liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or
         loss.                                                                    
                                                                                  
         Trade and other payables include trade payables and other current and non-current, non-interest-bearing financial
         liabilities. Borrowings (long term and short term) include bank loans and overdrafts. These liabilities are initially
         recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value (net of any transaction costs), and subsequently
         measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

         The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating
         interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated
         future cash payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective
         interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability,
         or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the amortised cost of a financial liability.
                                                                                  
         The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled
         or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised, and the
         consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss           
                                                                                  
         3.13 Cash and cash equivalents                                           
         Cash and cash equivalents include cash, bank deposits and commercial papers with original maturities of three
         months or less.                                                          
         The Group presents the statement of cash flows using the indirect method. Cash inflows and outflows are shown
         separately for investing and financing activities, while operating activities include both cash and non-cash line
         items. Interest received and paid, and dividends received, are reported as a part of operating activities. Dividends
         distributed are included as a part of financing activities. Value Added Tax and other similar taxes are regarded as
         collection of tax on behalf of authorities.                              
                                                                                  
         3.14 Employee benefits                                                   
         The Group operates a defined contribution plan for post-retirement benefits. A defined contribution plan is a pension
         plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate entity (insurance company). The Group has no
         legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions to the pension plan for benefits relating to employee
         service in the current and prior periods. Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised
         as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. Prepaid contributions are
         recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
                                                                                  
         3.15 Taxation                                                            
         Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
                                                                                  
         Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax because it
         excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that
         are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s current tax liability is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted
         or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.             
         A provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax determination is uncertain, but it is considered
         probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority. The provisions are measured at the best
         estimate of the amount expected to become payable.                       
                                                                                  
         Deferred tax is recognized based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
         in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable
         profit and is accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
         temporary differences and deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences are recognized to the
         extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can
         be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent
         that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be

         Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the
         liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end
         of the reporting period.                                                 
                                                                                  
         Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets
         against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the
         Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
                                                                                  
         Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in
         other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in
         other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial
         accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.
                                                                                  
         3.16 Provisions                                                          
         Provisions for e.g. workforce reductions (restructuring), onerous contracts and legal claims are recognised when
         the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group
         will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The
         amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation
         at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation, and discounted to its
         present value.

         estimation variances                                                     
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
         In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, as described in note 3 (summary of significant accounting
         policies), management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
         of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are
         based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are considered to be
         relevant. Future events may cause these estimates to change and actual results may differ from these estimates.
         Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.   
                                                                                  
         Changes in accounting estimates are recognised in the period when the changes occurred, if they apply to that period.
         If the changes also apply to future periods, the effect will be distributed between the current period and future periods.
                                                                                  
         Business combinations                                                    
         The Group has finalised certain acquisitions in FY2020. Refer to note 5 (business combinations) for further details.
         In order to account for the business combinations and determine the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities
         in accordance with IFRS 3, management has used significant judgement. In order to calculate the fair value of the
         intangible assets in the acquired companies, the expected future cash flows have been reconciled to the purchase
         price of the acquired companies. The reconciliation is performed via a Business Enterprise Valuation (BEV). Intangible
         assets have been valued using the Multi Excess Earnings Method (“MEEM”) and Relief From Royalty Method (“RFR”).
         The methods are considered to be appropriate for the type of assets being valued (MEEM for customer relationships
         and RFR for technology and trade name). The excess of the consideration over the fair value of the net identifiable
         assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.

         Significant input used in the estimation of fair values utilising the above methods are as follows:
                                                                                  
         y The remaining estimated useful life of customer relationships is between 7 and 10 years
         y The remaining estimated useful life of technology is 10 years          
         y Revenue growth and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins are based on
          estimates of growth and margins in the respective companies             
                                                                                  
         Estimated impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets             
         The carrying amounts of non-current tangible and intangible assets are assessed by means of impairment tests
         whenever there is an indication of impairment. Any impairment of goodwill is assessed at least annually. The
         recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These
         calculations require management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit
         and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. As of 31 December 2020, the amount of goodwill
         tested for impairment amounted to KNOK 3 982 843 (FY2019 - KNOK 3 389 875). No impairment losses were
         recognised in FY2020 (FY2019 - nil). Please refer to notes 3 (summary of significant accounting policies) and 12
         (intangible assets) for further details related to the impairment testing methodology and results.
                                                                                  
         Deferred tax assets                                                      
         Management judgment is required in determining provisions for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities
         and the extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized. The Group is also subject to income taxes in various
         jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the Group’s provision for income taxes. There may be transactions
         and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where
         the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will
         impact the income tax and deferred tax liability and expense in the period in which such determination is made.
                                                                                  
         Purchase price of subsidiaries – earn-out                                
         Periodically, the Group acquires subsidiaries where the preliminary purchase price is based on an assumption that
         the acquired company will achieve a target EBITDA for the current financial year. The final purchase price is subject
         to an upwards or downwards earn-out adjustment based on the company’s actual achieved EBITDA. The earn-out
         adjustment is accounted for in the income statement as finance income or expense.

         The Group reports revenue, gross margin (revenue less direct costs) and adjusted EBITDA in functional operating
         segments to the Board of Directors (the Group’s chief operating decision makers). While LINK uses all four measures
         to analyze performance, the Group’s strategy of profitable growth means that adjusted EBITDA is the prevailing
         measure of performance (refer to alternate performance measures).        
         An examination of operating units based on market maturity and product development as well as geography identifies
         four natural reporting segments. These are the Nordics, Western Europe, Central Europe, and Global Messaging; these
         represent market clusters. Generally, regions are segregated into similar geographic locations as these follow similar
         market trends. Common routing includes all regions with aggregator traffic; the other three have enterprise traffic.

         Global messaging is comprised of non-enterprise traffic and is representative of either stand-alone business or as
         a component of revenues in countries included above. If a business is comprised of both enterprise and wholesale/
         aggregator transactions, the latter is segregated here. The Swiss operation Horisen Messaging is included here.
                                                                                  
         Wholesale/aggregator business is defined as an operating unit within LINK’s industry, and that use LINK connections
         in markets where they do not have such connections themselves. This business can generally be referred to, at least
         partly, as a direct competitor that use LINK connections. Smaller local aggregators cannot be expected to be covered
         efficiently by Global Messaging and as such they are still subject to local management.

         The total cash outflow for leases in 2020 was KNOK 13,179 (2019: KNOK 11,510).
                                                                                  
         The Group’s leasing activities and how these are accounted for:          
         The Group leases office space, equipment and vehicles. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods
         between 1 and 10 years but may have extension options as described below.
                                                                                  
         Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract
         to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. However, for leases of real estate
         (buildings) for which the group is a lessee, it has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components and
         instead accounts for these as a single lease component.                  
                                                                                  
         Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The
         lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are held
         by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.
                                                                                  
         From 01 January 2019, leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at
         which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.                
                                                                                  
         Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the
         net present value of the following lease payments:                       
                                                                                  
         y Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;
         y Variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the
          commencement date;                                                      
                                                                                  
         y Amounts expected to be payable by the group under residual value guarantees;
         y The exercise price of a purchase option if the group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and
         y Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the group exercising that option.
                                                                                  
         Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of
         the liability.

         The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily
         determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being
         the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value
         to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.
                                                                                  
         To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:                  
                                                                                  
         y Where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted to
          reflect changes in financing conditions since third party financing was received;
         y Uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by Group
          subsidiaries, which do not have recent third-party financing; and       
         y Makes adjustments specific to the lease (i.e. term, country, currency and security).
                                                                                  
         The Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are
         not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or
         rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.
                                                                                  
         Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over
         the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each
         period.                                                                  
                                                                                  
         Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:       
                                                                                  
         y The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;              
         y Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;
         y Any initial direct costs; and                                          
                                                                                  
         y Restoration costs.                                                     
                                                                                  
         Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on
         a straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is
         depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life. While the Group revalues its land and buildings that are presented
         within property, plant and equipment, it has chosen not to do so for the right-of-use buildings held by the Group.
                                                                                  
         Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are
         recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of
         12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.
                                                                                  
         Variable lease payments:                                                 
         The Group is not exposed to variable lease payments.                     
                                                                                  
         Extension and termination options:                                       
         Extension and termination options are included in certain property and equipment leases across the Group. These are
         used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s operations. The majority
         of extension and termination options held are mutually exercisable and are evaluated accordingly.

         The pension plans in the Group comply with the pension legislation enacted in respective countries. The pension
         plans require that the Group pays premiums to public or private administrative pension plans on a mandatory,
         contractual or voluntary basis. There are no further obligations once the annual premiums are paid. The premiums
         are accounted for as personnel expenses as soon as they are incurred. Pre-paid premiums are accounted for as an
         asset to the extent that future benefits can be determined as plausible.

         equal to 2 months of base salary.                                        
                                                                                  
         Share based remuneration                                                 
         The Company has two programs for share based remuneration for its employees: the Restricted Share Unit (RSU)
         program and the long-term incentive plan (LTI) option program. Fair value of the RSU’s and LTI’s are calculated at the
         time of allocation and expensed over the vesting period.                 
                                                                                  
         The Company issued 3,769,092 RSU’s and 2,000,000 LTI’s in Q4 2020 to selected employees, including management.
         Fair value of RSU’s and LTI’s were calculated to NOK 46.995 (for all practical purposes equal to the share price) and
         NOK 20.3 at the grant date, respectively.                                
                                                                                  
         Grant date for both RSU’s and LTI’s is set at 20.10.2020. The “strike price” of RSU’s is NOK 0.005 (equal to the nominal
         value of the shares) and the strike price of the LTI’s is NOK 47.        
                                                                                  
         An expense of NOK 35 million (including accrued social security tax) related to share options has been recorded in
         the fourth quarter. The expenses related to the RSU and LTI are NOK 27 million and NOK 8 million, respectively.

         As at 31.12.2021 there was a total of NOK 4,006,460 accrued in social security expenses, based on a weighted
         average of the social security tax rates in the recipients countries.    
                                                                                  
         Fair value of the RSUs and options are calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
         The following assumptions are used in the calculations:                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
         y The share price is set equal to the offer price on October 20th 2020 (date of completetion of the Initial Public
          Offering (IPO)) of Link Mobility Group Holding ASA.                     
         y The strike price for the RSUs is set equal to the nominal share value (NOK 0.005).
                                                                                  
         y Expected volatility is set identical to historical volatility, equal to 61 % in the calculations.
         y We assume that historical volatility of a selected group comparable companies within the CPaaS-univserse
          is an indication of future volatility.                                  
         y We assume that the employees will exercise the options at the mid-point between earliest and latest
          possible exercise possibility.                                          
                                                                                  
         y Risk free rate used in the calculations is set equal to the rate of Norwegian treasury bills and Government
          Bonds corresponding to the lifetime of the option.

        The LINK name was established in 2008 and has become a known name within the mobile solutions industry.
        The estimated useful life is determined to be 25 years and is amortised accordingly. The trade name has not been
        allocated to specific CGUs.                                               
                                                                                  
        Customer Relationships                                                    
        For customer relationships identified and recognised through business combinations, the amortisation period is
        estimated to be between 7-10 years. The amortisation period is based on an analysis of customer churn and the
        remaining useful life of the customer relationships recogonised in the balance sheet.

        Amortisation of capital expenditure for the development of Group technology is between 3-10 years. For technology
        acquired through business combinations, the amortisation period is between 7-10 years based on an evalution of
        the technological solution.

        Goodwill generated from business combinations is primarily related to anticipated growth prospects for the acquired
        businesses. No impairment has been recognised subsequent to the business combination.

        “Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised. They are tested for impairment
        on an annual basis at a cash generating unit (hereafter “”CGU””) level, and more frequently if there are indications
        that amounts may be impaired. In accordance with IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets, the carrying amount of the
        CGU to which goodwill has been allocated is compared with the recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable
        amount is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections reflective
        of management’s best estimate extended over a five year period. The assumed growth rate has been based on the
        management growth estimate for the next five years and subsequently reduced to 2% for the purpose of determining
        the terminal value. The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flows are calculated based on the weighted
        average cost of capital (WACC) specific to each CGU and are within the range of 7.7% - 12.0%.
                                                                                  
        Based on the calculations referred to above, it has been concluded that the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying
        amount of each CGU. No impairment has been recognized for FY2020 (FY2019 - nil).

         The impairment test shows that the recoverable amounts significantly exceed the carrying amount of the CGUs.
                                                                                  
         Sensitivity analysis                                                     
         In connection with the impairment testing of intangible assets, a sensitivity analysis has been performed. The
         sensitivity analysis has tested changes in terminal growth; if no terminal growth (zero-rated) is used, there is still
         impairment headroom for all CGU’s with the exception of Hungary. The estimates used to determine future cash
         flows and WACC when calculating value in use are subject to uncertainty. The assumptions are described as follows:
                                                                                  
         Budgeted period - The basis for the projection of the future cash flows estimated is based on the financial budget
         of one year. The budget in combination with the forecasts represent management’s best estimate of the range
         of economic conditions that will exist over a five-year period. The forecasted years are estimated based on the
         company’s strategic initiatives.                                         
                                                                                  
         Local currency and Fx rates - All CGU’s forecasted projections are done using NOK.
                                                                                  
         Terminal value - terminal value is calculated using the Gordon growth formula based on previous year cash-flow,
         user-specified long-term growth and WACC for the specific CGU.           
                                                                                  
         WACC - future cash flows are discounted to present value using a discounted rate based on a calculation of a
         weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The pre-tax WACC is based on an average interest rate adjusted for each CGU.
                                                                                  
         Management have concluded that no forseable change in any of the key assumptions used in the impairment test
         would cause the carrying amounts of the cash-generating units with significant goodwill to exceed recoverable
         amounts.

         The above trade receivables and other receivables represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the
         balance sheet date.                                                      
                                                                                  
         Trade accounts receivable relate to the sale of mobile messaging transactions, payment services, licenses, and
         consulting services; these are withing the normal operating cycle.       
                                                                                  
         Accrued revenues are representative of an estimate for messaging traffic. An accrual for revenue is made to best
         reflect volumes in advance of when an invoice from the telecommunications provider is received.
                                                                                  
         The Group measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.
         Based on historical trends, the Group recognises a loss allowance of 100% against all receivables over 120 days past
         due, unless it is probable that the receivable will be collected based on past experience with customer and financial
         position of the debtor. Additional allowances for specific balances are recognised based on past experience and an
         analysis of the financial position of the debtor along with other relevant factors.
                                                                                  
         There is no loss allowance related to accrued revenues.                  
                                                                                  
         The Group has recognised a provision for bad debts of KNOK 29 617 (FY2019 - KNOK 27 882). Trade receivables
         recognised as a part of business combinations are recognised at fair value on the date of acquisition, allowance for
         impairment amounted to KNOK 302 (FY2019 - KNOK 15 776).

         and subsidiary accounts to cover deposit and withdrawal activity wihin the arrangement.
                                                                                  
         LINK Mobility Group AS is the cash pool administrator/master and holder of the top accounts in different currencies
         (defined as Facility Accounts). In addition to Facility Accounts, various transactional accounts exist in the same
         currency as the Facility Account; these are defined as Detail Accounts.  
                                                                                  
         Funds deposited into a Detail Account are automatically and instantly transferred to a Facility Account. Similarly,
         funds withdrawn from a Detail Account are automatically and instantly transferred from a Facility Account. The
         Detail Accounts maintain a balance of zero, whereas each Facility Account holds the credit or debit balance of the
         funds available for drawing in the cash pool.                            
                                                                                  
         A Facility Account (and its balance) is owned solely by LINK and creates rights and obligations only between LINK
         and the bank. The balance on the Facility Accounts is subject to interest calculations between LINK and the bank.
         Transactions (deposits or withdrawals) cannot be performed on a Facility Account, but must be performed using a
         Detail Account.                                                          
                                                                                  
         The Bank registers each transaction between each Facility Account and each Detail Account in the cash pool and the
         total balance thereof. This balance reflects the intra-Group balance between LINK and each Detail Account Holder.
         The participating entities of the Group have internal balances toward LINK through the use of the Detail Accounts.

         The financial assets held by the Group are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in
         order to collect contractual cash flows and are thus measured subsequently at amortised cost less loss allowances.
                                                                                  
         All financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost.                
                                                                                  
         The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value as at 31 December 2020.
         Arrangements with financial institutions are entered into on market terms, and the carrying value at the reporting date

         ¹ The bond loan is initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs and it is subsequently measured at
         amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Consequently, the transaction cost will be amortized over the
         life of the bond loan. The carrying value of the bond loan will be equal to the principal amount of EUR 200 million at
         maturity in FY2025.

         Interest rate risk                                                       
         Interest rate risk arises as a consequence of long-term debt. In December 2020 the Company successfully completed
         the issuance of EUR 200 million senior unsecured bonds, with a EUR 350 million borrowing limit (refer to note 18 for
         further details).                                                        
                                                                                  
         The sensitivity analysis below is based on the exposure to changes in interest rates for non-derivative instruments at
         the reporting date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount outstanding at reporting
         date was outstanding for the whole year. A one percent increase or decrease represents management’s assessment
         of reasonable and possible changes in interest rates.                    
         If interest rates had been one percent higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit (and
         corresponding equity) for the period ended 31 December 2020 would decrease/increase by KNOK 2 000 (FY2019
         KNOK 4 672). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
                                                                                  
         Foreign exchange risk                                                    
         The Group undertakes business in foreign currencies and is consequently exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates.
         Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions related to operations conducted, and assets and liabilities arising in
         foreign currencies. The Group undertakes transactions denominated in NOK, DKK, EUR, SEK, PLN, BGN, CHF, GBP,
         HUF, RON and MKD. Revenue and cost transactions within foreign subsidiaries are normally carried out in the same
         currency, which mitigates the currency risk.                             
                                                                                  
         However, as the Group’s overall financial reporting is presented in NOK, changes in the value of DKK, EUR, SEK,
         PLN, BGN, CHF, GBP, HUF, RON or MKD in relation to NOK affect the Group’s overall revenue, profit or loss and
         financial position. Based on exposure throughout the year and balances at the period-end, the Group assesses that
         fluctuations in NOK/EUR, NOK/SEK and NOK/CHF have the most significant impact on the financial reporting of
         financial assets and liabilities. The table below summarises the impact a change in these currencies will have on the
         consolidated income statement and on retained earnings/accumulated losses as at 31 December 2020. The analysis
         is based on the assumption that the foreign exchange rates increase or decrease by 10%, all other variables held constant.

         Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty defaulting. The Group’s credit risk is limited to trade and other receivables and
         is mitigated by the Group’s guidelines to ensure that credit sales are only made to customers with high credit rating.
         Customers with a low credit rating are required to prepay for services rendered by the Group.

        The Group’s credit risk related to trade receivables is assessed to be limited due to the high number of diverse
        customers in the Group’s customer base. Refer to note 14 for additional information related to trade and other receivables.
        The carrying value of trade and other receivables represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date.
        Liquidity risk                                                            
        Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations when they mature, resulting in default.
        The Group considers its liquidity risk to be limited, and has sufficient liquidity available on bank accounts as of year-end.
                                                                                  
        Refer to notes 18 and 20 for information about maturity of trade and other payables and borrowings.
        The Group has no credit facilities. Subsidiaries receive all funding from the Group and are not permitted to raise external
        financing independently.                                                  
        The Group has financial debt covenants related to the senior unsecured bonds. Refer to note 18 for information about

         As at 31 December 2020 and as at the date of signing of this annual report, certain Group subsidiaries are involved in
         ongoing legal proceedings as either defendant or as plaintiff. Due to the uncertain outcome for all of these ongoing
         proceedings, there are no provisions (contingent or otherwise) accounted for in the financial statements or disclosed
         elsewhere in the notes to the financial statements. Claims for which Group entities are defendants are deemed to be low
         risk as the majority are covered by guarantees as a result of acquisitions (M&A).
         A list of ongoing legal proceedings is provided as follows:

         On 15 April 2020, LINK Mobility Group Holding ASA entered into a definitive agreement for the acquisition of

         developed an omnichannel marketing platform with an integrated customer data platform (CDP) giving customers a
         unified profile view.

         The financial information in this report is prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as
         adopted by the EU. To enhance the understanding of LINK’s performance, the Group presents several alternative
         performance measures (“APM’s”). An APM is defined by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)
         guidelines as a financial measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other
         than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework (IFRS).
                                                                                  
         See below for a reconciliation of EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin.
         Below, LINK presents certain APMs, including gross margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin.
         APMs such as EBITDA are commonly reported by companies in the markets in which LINK competes and are widely
         used by investors when comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to factors such as depreciation
         and amortization, which can vary significantly, depending upon accounting methods (particularly when acquisitions
         have occurred) or based on non-operating factors.

         Gross Profit means revenues less direct costs of services rendered.

         Gross margin means gross profit as a percentage of total operating revenues.

         Adjusted EBITDA means EBITDA adjusted by expenses related to significant one-time, non-recurring events such as
         acquisitions and restructuring activities, legal advisors, and share-based compensation. LINK has presented adjusted
         EBITDA in the consolidated statement of profit and loss because management believes the measure provides useful
         information regarding operating performance.                             
                                                                                  
         Adjusted EBITDA margin                                                   
         Adjusted EBITDA margin is presented as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total operating
         revenues in the respective periods.

         EBITDA means earnings before interest, taxes, amortization, depreciation, and impairments. LINK has presented
         EBITDA in the consolidated statement of profit and loss because management believes that the measure provides
         useful information regarding the Group’s ability to service debt and to fund capital expenditures and provides a
         helpful measure for comparing its operating performance with that of other companies.

         LINK Mobility Group Holding ASA (“the Company”) is a limited liability Company incorporated and domiciled in Norway.
         The address of the registered office is Langkaia 1 – Havnelageret, 0150 Oslo, Norway. LINK Mobility Group Holding
         ASA is the parent company of the LINK Mobility Pecunia AS, which in turn is the parent company of LINK Mobility
         Group AS (“the Group”). The Group provides services in mobile communication and specialises in mobile messaging
         services, mobile solutions and mobile intelligence.                      
                                                                                  
         These financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on date 26 April 2021. Minor rounding
         differences may be present and the total may deviate from the total of the individual amounts. This is due to the
         rounding of whole figures to thousands for presentation purposes.        
                                                                                  
         3.2 Basis for preparation                                                
         The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
         Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the European
         Union. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
                                                                                  
         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting
         estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgments in applying the Group’s accounting policies. Areas
         involving a high degree of judgment or complexity, and areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant
         to the financial statements are disclosed in note 4 (critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation
         variances). The financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis.
                                                                                  
         The presentation currency of the financial statement is Norwegian kroner (NOK).

         3.3 Principles of consolidation                                          
         The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries,
         which are entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when the Group has power over the investee, is
         exposed, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power
         to affect its returns. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate
         that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control noted above. The financial statements of the
         subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting periods as the parent company and consistent accounting policies
         are applied. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement
         from the date when control is obtained and until control ceases, respectively. Intercompany transactions, balances,
         revenues, expenses and unrealised Group internal gains or losses are eliminated on consolidation.
                                                                                  
         When the group ceases to consolidate an investee because of a loss of control, any retained interest in the entity is
         remeasured to its fair value with the change in the carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value of the
         retained interest becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the investment.
                                                                                  
         3.4 Business combinations                                                
         Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred and all the
         identifiable assets and liabilities of acquired entities are measured at fair values at the date of acquisition, except
         deferred tax assets or liabilities and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements, which are
         recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively.
         Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.  
                                                                                  
         Goodwill is measured at the amount by which the total consideration transferred exceeds the net fair value of assets
         acquired. Goodwill is not amortised, but its value is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when
         there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, may be impaired. Goodwill
         is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash generating units) that is expected to
         benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its
         carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any
         impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not
         reversed in subsequent periods.                                          
                                                                                  
         When the consideration transferred by the Company in a business combination includes contingent consideration
         arrangements, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of
         the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that
         qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments recognised
         in goodwill. Measurement period adjustments arise from additional information obtained during the ‘measurement
         period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the
         acquisition date. The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not
         qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent
         consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent
         settlement is accounted for within equity. Other contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at subsequent
         reporting dates with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.

         I f the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the
         combination occurs, the Company reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
         Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see above), or additional assets or
         liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the
         acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
                                                                                  
         On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination
         of the profit or loss on disposal.                                       
                                                                                  
         3.5 Revenue recognition                                                  
         Revenues are recognised when services are rendered and measured based on the consideration to which the
         Company expects to be entitled in a contract with a customer net of discounts and sales related taxes. The
         Company recognises revenue when it transfers control of a product or service to a customer.
                                                                                  
         In order to determine whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent, the Company assesses whether
         the Company controls the service before it is provided to the customer. Where the Company does not control the
         service, the Company is considered an agent in the transaction.          
                                                                                  
         Revenues primarily comprise sale of services that enable customers to communicate by mobile phone with their
         customers. In order to be able to render these services, the Company needs to obtain services from one or more
         telecommunication operators.                                             
                                                                                  
         The services rendered are split into the following groups:

         3.6 Foreign currency translation                                         
         In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s
         functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
         transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are
         retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in
         foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary
         items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated after the transaction
         date.                                                                    
                                                                                  
         Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the
         income statement as financial items. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented on a net basis in the
         income statement as other operating expenses. Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in
         which they arise.                                                        
                                                                                  
         For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company’s
         foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are
         translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that
         period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are
         recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity.
                                                                                  
         Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are considered as assets and
         liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. These exchange differences are recognised in other
         comprehensive income.                                                    
                                                                                  
         On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Company’s entire interest in a foreign operation), or a
         disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, all of the exchange differences
         accumulated in a separate component of equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the
         company are reclassified to profit or loss. In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes
         a foreign operation that does not result in the Company losing control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share
         of accumulated exchange differences is re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in profit or
         loss.

         3.7 Intangible assets                                                    
         Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised initially as set out in 3.4 Business
         Combinations above.                                                      
         Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing,
         goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s cash-generating units (or Companys of cash-generating units)
         expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been
         allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be
         impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the
         impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to
         the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment
         loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. On disposal of a cash generating unit, the
         attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
                                                                                  
         Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are recognised
         initially at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).
         Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less
         accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis
         over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each
         reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible
         assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
                                                                                  
         Separately acquired intangible assets                                    
         Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated
         amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent to initial recognition, separately acquired intangible
         assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis
         as intangible assets that are acquired in a business combination.        
                                                                                  
         Internally generated intangible assets – technology                      
         Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally-
         generated intangible asset arising from development of the Companys technical platforms and products is
         recognised if, and only if, all the following conditions have been demonstrated:
         y the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
         y the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;     
         y the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;                       
         y how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
         y the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell
          the intangible asset; and                                               
         y the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
                                                                                  
         The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred
         from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally
         generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period
         in which it is incurred.                                                 
         Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated
         amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired in a

         3.8 Equipment and fixtures                                               
         Equipment and fixtures are initially recognised at cost, which includes the purchase price (including duties and non-
         refundable purchase taxes) and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition
         necessary for it to be able to operate in the intended manner. Equipment and fixtures are subsequently recognised at
         cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is recognised so as to
         reduce the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method. Depreciation
         commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.              
         Estimated useful life, depreciation method and residual values are reviewed at least annually. The straight-line
         depreciation method is used as this best reflects the consumption of the assets, which often is the passage of time.
         Residual value is estimated to be zero for all assets.                   
                                                                                  
         Repair and maintenance is expensed as incurred. If new parts are capitalised, replaced parts are derecognised and
         any remaining net carrying amount is recognised in operating profit (loss) as loss on disposal.
                                                                                  
         An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
         expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an
         item of equipment and fixtures is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount
         of the asset and is presented as other income or other expenses in the income statement.
         3.9 Impairment of non-financial assets                                   
         At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible
         assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
         indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if
         any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Company estimates
         the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent
         basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or
         otherwise they are allocated to the smallest Company of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent
         allocation basis can be identified.                                      
         Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever
         there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.                   
                                                                                  
         Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
         estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
         market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future
         cash flows have not been adjusted.                                       
                                                                                  
         If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
         carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
         recognised immediately in profit or loss.                                
                                                                                  
         Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is
         increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not
         exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset
         (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss,
         unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated
         as a revaluation increase. Any impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

         3.10 IFRS 16 Leases                                                      
         The Company initially applied IFRS 16 from 01 January 2019; IFRS 16 is applied using the modified
         retrospective approach. When applying the modified retrospective method, a lessee measures the right-of-
         use asset at either its carrying amount as if IFRS 16 had always been applied singe the commencement date
         (discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application), or at an amount equal to
         the lease liability (adjusted for previously recognised prepaid or accrued lease payments). The choice between
         the two options shall be made on a lease-by-lease basis.                 
                                                                                  
         The Company has chosen to measure the right-of-use asset at an amount equal to the lease liability for all
         leases by using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate; the rate may differ from country to country.
                                                                                  
         The lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a
         similar term, and with similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value of the right-of-
         use asset in a similar economic environment.                             
                                                                                  
         The Company used a number of practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously classified as
         operating leases under IAS 17. Specifically, the Company:                
         y did not recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with a lease term that ends within 12 months
                                                                                  
          from the date of application;                                           
         y did not recognise right-of-use assets anf liabilities for leases of low value assets;
         y excluded initial dirct cost from the measurement of the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application;
          and                                                                     
         y used hindsight when determining the lease term.                        
                                                                                  
         The Company has elected to use the exemptions in the standard on short-term lease contracts and for lease
         contracts where the underlying asset is of low value. These leases are recognised as operation expenses in
         the profit and loss.                                                     
                                                                                  
         3.12 Financial Instruments                                               
         Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly
         attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets
         and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the
         financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
                                                                                  
         The categorisation of financial instruments (financial assets and liabilities) for measurement purposes is
         based on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument and is determined on initial recognition. The
         Company presents financial assets and liabilities in the following classes: trade and other receivables, cash
         and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, and borrowings.          
                                                                                  
         Financial assets                                                         
         The financial assets held by the Company, primarily trade and other receivables, are held within a business
         model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and are thus
         measured subsequently at amortised cost less loss allowances. The impairment model in IFRS 9 Financial
         Instruments requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses (ECL).

         expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. The
         impairment is calculated by taking into account the historic evidence of the level of credit losses experienced and the
         ageing profile of the trade receivables. Individual trade receivables are impaired when management assesses them
         not to be wholly or partially collectible.                               
                                                                                  
         Financial liabilities                                                    
         Trade and other payables include trade payables and other current and non-current, non-interest-bearing financial
         liabilities. Borrowings (long term and short term) include bank loans and overdrafts. These liabilities are initially
         recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value (net of any transaction costs), and subsequently
         measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.     
                                                                                  
         The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating
         interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated
         future cash payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest
         rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where
         appropriate) a shorter period, to the amortised cost of a financial liability.
                                                                                  
         The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged,
         cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised, and the
         consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.          
                                                                                  
         3.13 Cash and cash equivalents                                           
         Cash and cash equivalents include cash, bank deposits and commercial papers with original maturities of three
         months or less.                                                          
                                                                                  
         The Company presents the statement of cash flows using the indirect method. Cash inflows and outflows are shown
         separately for investing and financing activities, while operating activities include both cash and non-cash line items.
         Interest received and paid, and dividends received, are reported as a part of operating activities. Dividends distributed
         are included as a part of financing activities. Value Added Tax and other similar taxes are regarded as collection of
         tax on behalf of authorities.                                            
                                                                                  
         3.14 Employee benefits                                                   
         The Company operates a defined contribution plan for post-retirement benefits. A defined contribution plan is a
         pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions to a separate entity (insurance company). The
         Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions to the pension plan for benefits relating
         to employee service in the current and prior periods. Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans
         are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. Prepaid
         contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is
         available.

         3.15 Taxation                                                            
         Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
                                                                                  
         Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax because it
         excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items
         that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s current tax liability is calculated using tax rates that have been
         enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.     
         A provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax determination is uncertain, but it is considered
         probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority. The provisions are measured at the best
         estimate of the amount expected to become payable.                       
                                                                                  
         Deferred tax is recognized based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
         in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable
         profit and is accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
         temporary differences and deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences are recognized to the
         extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be
         utilized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that
         it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
                                                                                  
         Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the
         liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
         end of the reporting period.                                             
                                                                                  
         Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets
         against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the
         Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
                                                                                  
         Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in
         other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised
         in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from
         the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business
         combination.                                                             
                                                                                  
         3.16 Provisions                                                          
         Provisions for e.g. workforce reductions (restructuring), onerous contracts and legal claims are recognised when the
         Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Company
         will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The
         amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation
         at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation, and discounted to

         In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, as described in note 3 (summary of significant accounting
         policies), management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
         of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are
         based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are considered to be
         relevant. Future events may cause these estimates to change and actual results may differ from these estimates.
         Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.   
                                                                                  
         Changes in accounting estimates are recognised in the period when the changes occurred, if they apply to that
         period. If the changes also apply to future periods, the effect will be distributed between the current period and future
         periods.                                                                 
                                                                                  
         Business combinations                                                    
         The Company has finalised certain acquisitions in FY2020; refer to note 5 (business combinations) for further
         details. In order to account for the business combinations and determine the fair value of the underlying assets and
         liabilities in accordance with IFRS 3, management has used significant judgement. In order to calculate the fair
         value of the intangible assets in the acquired companies, the expected future cash flows have been reconciled to
         the purchase price of the acquired companies. The reconciliation is performed via a Business Enterprise Valuation
         (BEV). Intangible assets have been valued using the Multi Excess Earnings Method (“MEEM”) and Relief From Royalty
         Method (“RFR”). The methods are considered to be appropriate for the type of assets being valued (MEEM for
         customer relationships and RFR for technology and trade name). The excess of the consideration over the fair value
         of the net identifiable assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.       
                                                                                  
         Significant input used in the estimation of fair values utilising the above methods are as follows:
         y The remaining estimated useful life of customer relationships is between 7 and 10 years
         y The remaining estimated useful life of technology is 10 years          
         y Revenue growth and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins are based on
          estimates of growth and margins in the respective companies             
                                                                                  
         Estimated impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets             
         The carrying amounts of non-current tangible and intangible assets are assessed by means of impairment tests
         whenever there is an indication of impairment. Any impairment of goodwill is assessed at least annually. The
         recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These
         calculations require management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit
         and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. As of 31 December 2020, the amount of goodwill
         tested for impairment amounted to KNOK 3 982 843                         
         (FY2019 - KNOK 3 389 875). No impairment losses were recognised in FY2020 (FY2019 - nil). Please refer to notes 3
         (summary of significant accounting policies) and 12 (intangible assets) for further details related to the impairment
         testing methodology and results.

        Deferred tax assets                                                       
        Management judgment is required in determining provisions for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities
        and the extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized. The Company is also subject to income taxes in
        various jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes. There may be
        transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of
        business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded,
        such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax liability and expense in the period in which such
        determination is made.                                                    
                                                                                  
        Purchase price of subsidiaries – earn-out                                 
        Periodically, the Company acquires subsidiaries where the preliminary purchase price is based on an assumption
        that the acquired company will achieve a target EBITDA for the current financial year. The final purchase price is
        subject to an upwards or downwards earn-out adjustment based on the company’s actual achieved EBITDA. The
        earn-out adjustment is accounted for in the income statement as finance income or expense.

         The financial assets held by the Company are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial
         assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and are thus measured subsequently at amortised cost less loss
         allowances.                                                              
                                                                                  
         All financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost.                
                                                                                  
         The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value as at 31 December 2020.
         Arrangements with financial institutions are entered into on market terms, and the carrying value at the reporting date

         On 15 December 2020, LINK Mobility Group Holding ASA (LINK) successfully completed the issuance of EUR 200
         million senior unsecured bonds, with a EUR 350 million borrowing limit.  
                                                                                  
         The bonds have a 5-year tenor and a fixed coupon of 3.375% p.a.; any outstanding bonds are to be repaid in full at
         the maturity date.

         ¹ The bond loan is initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs and it is subsequently measured at
         amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Consequently, the transaction cost will be amortized over the
         life of the bond loan. The carrying value of the bond loan will be equal to the principal amount of EUR 200 million at
         maturity in FY2025.

         Interest rate risk arises as a consequence of long-term debt. In December 2020 the Company successfully completed
         the issuance of EUR 200 million senior unsecured bonds, with a EUR 350 million borrowing limit (refer to note 18 for
         further details).                                                        
                                                                                  
         The sensitivity analysis below is based on the exposure to changes in interest rates for non-derivative instruments at
         the reporting date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount outstanding at reporting
         date was outstanding for the whole year. A one percent increase or decrease represents management’s assessment
         of reasonable and possible changes in interest rates.                    
                                                                                  
         If interest rates had been one percent higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit (and
         corresponding equity) for the period ended 31 December 2020 would decrease/increase by KNOK 2 000 (FY2019
         KNOK 0). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
                                                                                  
         Foreign exchange risk                                                    
         The Company is a holding company and does not actively undertake business in foreign currencies; as a
         consequence, exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates is limited. Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions
         related to operations conducted, and assets and liabilities arising in foreign currencies.

         The Company is a holding company and owns all shares in LINK Mobility Pecunia AS; credit risk is deemed to be low.

         Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company is unable to meet its financial obligations when they mature, resulting in
         default.                                                                 
                                                                                  
         The Company considers its liquidity risk to be limited, and has sufficient liquidity available on bank accounts as of
         year-end. Obligations are covered by transfer of cash from subisidiaries.
                                                                                  
         The Company has financial debt covenants related to the senior unsecured bonds. Refer to note 11 for information
         about the bond convenants.

         Deferred tax assets related to tax losses have not been recognised as it is deemed unlikely that the company will
         generate taxable income in the foreseeable future. The tax loss can be carried forward indefintiely.
                                                                                  
         The benefit from the interest cap carried forward is uncertain and the tax asset is not recognised. The amount can be
         carried forward for 10 years.

         The temporary differences are related to unrealized gains from currency translation. Deferred tax liability has not been
         recognised as it is deemed unlikely that the company will generate taxable income in the foreseeable future.

         statements are approved, that would lead to the recognition of a liability or require additional disclosure. Management

            The Board of Directors and the Managing Director (Management) are responsible for the preparation
            in accordance with law and regulations, including a true and fair view of the financial statements in
            accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such
            internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
            statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
            In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s and the
            Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
            concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to
            liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
                                                                                  
            Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  
                                                                                  
            Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
            are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report
            that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
            that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices
            generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it
            exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
            aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
            basis of these financial statements.                                  
            As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices
            generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
            professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:                
              •  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due
                 to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
                 obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
                 risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
                 resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
                 misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.         
              •  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
                 procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
                 opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's or the Group's internal control.

              •  conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting
                 and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
                 events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company and the Group's ability to
                 continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
                 to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements
                 or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the
                 audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or
                 conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
              •  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including
                 the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions
                 and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair view.       
              •  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
                 or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
                 statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group
                 audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.       
                                                                                  
            We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
            timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
            control that we identify during our audit.                            
            We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
            requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other
            matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related
            safeguards.                                                           
                                                                                  
            From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of
            most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the
            key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes
            public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a
            matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would
            reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

            Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the
            information presented in the Board of Directors’ report and in the statements on Corporate
            Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility concerning the financial statements, the going
            concern assumption and the proposed allocation of the result is consistent with the financial
            statements and complies with the law and regulations.                 
                                                                                  
            Opinion on Registration and Documentation                             
            Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have
            considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements
            (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial
