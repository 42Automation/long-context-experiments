        2     RISK FACTORS
        Investing in the Shares involves inherent risks. Prior to making any investment decision with respect to the Shares, an
        investor should carefully consider all of the information contained in this Prospectus, and in particular the risks and
        uncertainties described in this Section 2, which the Company believes are the most material known risks and
        uncertainties faced by the Group as of the date hereof. The risk factors presented in this Section are limited to the risks
        that the Company believes to be specific to the issuer and material for investors when making their investment decision.
        An investment in the Shares is suitable only for investors who understand the risks associated with this type of
        investment and who can afford to lose all or part of their investment.
        The risk factors presented in this Section are divided into a limited number of categories based on their nature. Within
        each category, the risk factors which are deemed by the Company to be the most material based on an overall
        assessment of the probability of their occurrence and the expected magnitude of their negative impact on the Group,
        are presented first. However, this does not imply that the remaining risk factors presented are ranked in order of their
        likelihood of occurrence or the severity or significance of each risk. The order of the categories does not intend to
        represent any assessment of the materiality or the probability of occurrence of the risk factors within that category,
        when compared to risk factors in another category. The absence of negative past experience associated with a given
        risk factor does not mean that the risks and uncertainties described are not a genuine potential threat to an investment
        in the Shares.
        Should any of the following risks occur, they could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, prospects,
        results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and the trading price of the Shares may decline, causing investors
        to lose all or part of their invested capital. Additional risks not presently known to the Company or which the Company
        currently deems not to be material may also have a material adverse effect on the Group. A prospective investor should
        consult his or her own expert advisors as to the suitability of an investment in the Company's Shares. It is not possible
        to quantify the significance to the Company of each individual risk factor as each of the risk factors mentioned below
        may materialise to a greater or lesser degree.
        The information in this Section 2 is accurate as of the date of this Prospectus.
        2.1   Risks related to the Group’s business activities and industry
        2.1.1 The Group may not be able to implement its M&A strategy successfully or manage its growth effectively
        The Group’s future growth will depend on the successful implementation of the six main pillars of the Group's business
        strategy. See Section 8.4 "Strategy and objectives". Mergers and acquisitions are a key component of the Group’s growth
        strategy (see Section 11.3.2 for an overview of the Group's previous acquisitions). The Group’s failure to execute its
        business strategy or to manage its growth effectively could adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of
        operations, cash flows and financial position. The Group’s Acquisition Revenue was NOK 104.0 million, NOK 803.9 million,
        NOK 584.1 million and NOK 38.6 million, for the periods ending 30 June 2020 and 31 December 2019, 2018 and 2017,
        respectively. In addition, there can be no guarantee that, even if the Group successfully implements the Group’s strategy,
        it would result in an improvement of the Group’s results of operations. The Group’s ability to achieve its business and
        financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the Group’s control.
        The integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other resources, including
        management time and attention, and may depend on the Group’s ability to retain the existing management and
        employees of the acquired business or recruit acceptable replacements. For example, it took the Group approximately
        one year to fully integrate TeraComm Group after the acquisition in 2019. Ultimately, if the Group is unsuccessful in
        integrating any acquisitions in a timely and cost-effective manner, the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations,
        cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected. Acquisitions may also expose the Group to
        liabilities that it may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition, for example, if acquired companies and business do
        not act, or have not acted, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Given the above, in particular the Group’s
        rapid growth strategy, this risk is of material and specific importance the Group. If the Group is unable to implement its
        strategy or successfully adapt to rapidly changing market conditions should consumer behaviour change, or if demand
        for its services decreases, then its business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be
        materially adversely affected.
        2.1.2 The markets in which the Group competes in are undergoing rapid technological change
        The communications industry has undergone significant technological development over time and these changes
        continue to affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The CPaaS market is evolving and
        is expanding in several directions as enterprise adoption of cloud-based communications occurs. From SMS, to WhatsApp
        Business, new and more complex communication methods continue to be introduced. For example, Juniper Research
        estimates that in the next five years RCS will continue to grow and represent a larger market of the Global A2P messaging
        revenue. Such changes have had, and will continue to have, a profound impact on customers’ needs and expectations.
        For the Group to survive and grow, the Group must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of
        the Group’s information delivery and retrieval product and services to address the customer’s changing needs. If new
        industry standards and practices emerge, the Group’s existing products, services and technology may become obsolete.
        Developing the Group’s products, services and other technologies entails significant technical and business risks and
        substantial costs. In addition, demand for the Group’s platform is also price sensitive. The Group must anticipate far in
        advance which technology it should use for the development of new products and services or the enhancement of existing
        products and services, and there is no guarantee that it will anticipate such changes correctly or timely. In addition, the
        market changes may result in changes in the demand mix for the Group's services, shifting them from high margin
        services such as advanced mobile solutions (Mobile Invoice, e.g.) to low margin services such as OTP traffic, resulting
        could result in an erosion of the Group’s margins. Given the above, in particular the rapid technological development in
        the market, changes in consumer sentiments and the expansion of the array of products available within the Group’s
                                         8


                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus

        market, this risk is of material and specific importance the Group. If the Group is unable to properly anticipate and
        address changes in the market and expectations of its customers, the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations,
        cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected. For more information regarding the risk the
        implementation of the Group’s strategy, see Section 2.1.1 "The Group may not be able to implement its M&A strategy
        successfully or manage its growth effectively".
        2.1.3 The Group may experience operational problems, system failures, defects or errors
        The Group's platform and services are based on inherently complex software technology, which may have real or
        perceived defects, errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in the platform and the Group's products could result in
        negative publicity or lead to data security, access, retention or other performance issues. The Group relies on network
        and information systems for its operations, some of which it outsources, and a disruption or failure of, or defects in,
        those systems may disrupt its operations, damage its reputation with customers and adversely affect its results of
        operations. Operational problems may lead to loss of revenue or higher than anticipated operating expenses may require
        additional capital expenditures. See Section 2.2.1 "The Group outsources certain of its IT functions to third parties and
        an interruption or cessation of any such services could adversely affect the Group". Any significant disruption, system
        failure, errors or defects could compromise the Group's ability to deliver contractual services and/or increased costs and
        result in the loss of customers, curtailed operations and the Group's reputation, any of which could have materially
        adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
        2.1.4 The Group is exposed to risks related to cyberattacks
        As the Group’s business and business strategy are tied to its technology, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms
        and other destructive or disruptive software, "cyber-attacks," phishing attacks and other malicious activity, can have a
        material effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations. For example, in last 12 months, several DDoS
        attacks were launched against the Group, and although the Group did not experience any material breaches, such events
        could have an adverse impact on the Group and its customers, including degradation of service, service disruption,
        excessive call volume to call centres, theft and damage to its plant, equipment and data, costs associated with
        remediation, notification, and potential damages to third parties affected by such malicious activities.
        IT security breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of the Group's systems and potential unauthorized disclosure
        of confidential information or data, including personal data. Data security breaches may also result in negative publicity
        resulting in reputation or brand damage. If the Group experiences a material data security breach or fails to detect and
        appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash
        flows, financial position and reputation could be materially adversely affected. Given the above, in particular that the
        Group has been subject in the past to cyberattacks and the nature of the Group’s business, this risk is of material and
        specific importance the Group. If the Group is unable to protect its platform and digital structure from cyber-threats,
        this could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows
        and/or prospects.
        2.1.5 The Group may be unable to attract, retain and train the required personnel
        As a high-growth company in a rapidly changing and complex industry, the Group's success depends to a significant
        extent upon the abilities and efforts of the Group's management team and its ability to retain key members of the
        management team and other highly skilled employees. There is intense competition for personnel with skills in areas
        such as coders, software developers and software engineers in the markets in which the Group operates and there are,
        and may continue to be, shortages in the availability of appropriately such personnel at all levels. Shortages of skilled
        personnel is particular prominent for skilled local sales force employees with critical know-how and expertise that are
        key to the Group’s success given its M&A and growth strategy. For example, if the Group expands into a new market, it
        needs to hire personnel with technical skills such as C# developers, but also with knowledge about the CPaaS market in
        such particular jurisdiction. Such layering of skills are difficult to find.
        Key to the Group's successful integration of acquired business has been the ability to insert into such businesses
        seasoned senior management from the Group, who are able to ensure that the Group’s methodology and business
        practices are properly implemented and applied throughout the acquired organisation. If the Group is unable to retain
        its senior management team, its M&A and growth strategy may be hindered. Because the Group operates in a relatively
        new market, the talent pool of senior management with significant experience is scares. In addition, in order to
        seamlessly integrate and later operate any acquired business, the Group needs to retain key skilled personnel from its
        acquired businesses, which has the necessary local knowledge that can help drive growth and integrate the acquired
        platforms with the Group's systems. The employees of an acquired company often become the targets of recruiters
        trying to lure them to other opportunities given the uncertainties that arise for employees at an acquired company. If
        the Group is unable to attract and retain key management personnel and other highly skilled employees, its business,
        prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.
        2.1.6 The Group may be unable to maintain competitive prices
        The Group’s ability to maintain or increase its profitability depends on its ability to offset decreases in sales prices by
        reducing the purchase cost of the services that it provides. In addition, pricing pressure may also be created if customers
        transact larger volumes on the Group’s platform for which they negotiate a lower price per transaction. If the Group is
        not able to negotiate correspondingly lower purchase costs from service providers for larger volumes, this may negatively
        impact the Group’s margins. If the Group is unable to offset decreases in sales prices or to otherwise maintain its
        competitive position, it may lose market share. For example, the Group has exited the Spanish market after the Group’s
        partner, Telefonica, S.A., lost many material customers to its main competitor that offered products and services at
        more competitive prices. Given the above, in particular the importance of margins to the Group’s financial success and
        the presence of local and/or international competitors in all of the markets in which the Group participates, this risk is
        of material and specific importance the Group. There can be no assurance that increased competition from current and
        potential competitors will not adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and
        financial position.
                                         9

        of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular person’s decision to acquire the Shares. This discussion
        applies only to U.S. Holders that purchase Shares in this offering and hold the Shares as capital assets for U.S. federal
        income tax purposes. In addition, it does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of a
        U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, including alternative minimum tax consequences, estate and gift tax laws, the
        tax on net investment income, and tax consequences applicable to U.S. Holders subject to special rules, such as:
                   banks or other financial institutions;
                   dealers or traders in securities who use a mark-to-market method of tax accounting;

                   insurance companies;
                   real estate investment trusts;

                   regulated investment companies;
                   persons holding Shares as part of a hedging transaction, straddle, wash sale, conversion transaction
                    or integrated transaction or persons entering into a constructive sale with respect to the Shares;
                   persons whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar;

                   entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
                   tax-exempt entities, including an "individual retirement account" or "Roth IRA" or other tax-
                    deferred accounts;
                   persons that own directly, indirectly or constructively own ten percent or more of the Company’s
                    voting stock or value;

                   persons who acquired Shares pursuant to the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as
                    compensation; or
                   persons holding Shares in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the United
                    States.
        If an entity or arrangement that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Shares, the
        U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner of such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner
        and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Shares and partners in such partnerships should consult their
        tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, beneficial ownership and
        disposition of the Shares.
        This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), its legislative history,
        administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), judicial decisions, the income tax
        treaty between Norway and the United States (the "Treaty") and final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations,
        all as of the date hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The Group has not sought
        any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in this discussion, and there
        can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with these statements and conclusions.
        A "U.S. Holder" is a person who, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a beneficial owner of Shares and:
                   a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
                   a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organised in or under the laws
                    of the United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; or
                   an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
                    source.
        U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of
        the acquisition, beneficial ownership and disposition of Shares in their particular circumstances.
        This discussion assumes that the Company is not, and will not become, a passive foreign investment company, as
        described below.
        16.2.2 Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules
        Special adverse U.S. federal income tax rules apply to U.S. persons owning shares of a passive foreign investment
        company, or PFIC. A non-U.S. entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will be
        classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year in which, after applying relevant look-
        through rules with respect to certain subsidiaries, either:
                   at least 75% of its gross income is "passive income" or,
                   at least 50% of the value of its assets, generally based on their quarterly average, is attributable
                    to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income.


                            Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus

        For this purpose, passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents and royalties, gains
        from the disposition of assets that produce passive income and gains from commodities transactions.

        The Company does not expect to be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the current taxable year or in in the
        foreseeable future. However, whether the Company is a PFIC will be determined annually based upon the composition
        and nature of its income, the composition, nature and valuation of its assets (including goodwill), all of which are subject
        to change (including in the current taxable year), and which may be determined in large part by reference to the market
        value of the Shares, which may be volatile. The determination of whether the Company is a PFIC will also depend upon
        the application of complex U.S. federal income tax rules concerning the classification of the Company’s assets (including
        goodwill) and income for this purpose, and the application of these rules is uncertain in some respects. Accordingly no
        assurance can be provided that the IRS will not successfully assert that the Company has been or will be a PFICfor the
        current year or any subsequent taxable year for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company will not provide annual
        determinations regarding its PFIC status for any taxable year.
        The Company’s ability to avoid being a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend on its ability to meet, on
        a continuing basis, through actual operating results, certain requirements regarding the nature of its gross assets and
        revenue. In particular, any cash the Company holds, including the cash raised in the Offering, is generally treated as
        held for the production of passive income for the purpose of the PFIC test, and any income generated from cash or other
        liquid assets is generally treated as passive income for such purpose. As a result, the Company’s ability to avoid being
        characterised as a PFIC may depend in part on its ability to deploy proceeds from this or future offerings within limited
        periods of time following such offering.
        If the Company were a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder held Shares, gain recognised by a U.S.
        Holder on a sale or other disposition (including certain pledges) of the Shares would be allocated ratably over the U.S.
        Holder’s holding period for the Shares. The amounts allocated to the taxable year of the sale or other disposition and to
        any year before the Company became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each other
        taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals or corporations, as appropriate, for that
        taxable year, and an interest charge (at the rate generally applicable to underpayments of tax) would be imposed on
        the tax on such amount. Further, to the extent that any distribution received by a U.S. Holder on its Shares exceeds
        125% of the average of the annual distributions on the Shares received during the preceding three years or the U.S.
        Holder’s holding period, whichever is shorter, that distribution would be subject to taxation in the same manner as gain,
        described immediately above. Certain elections may be available that would result in alternative treatments (such as
        mark-to-market or qualified electing fund treatment) of the Shares. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to
        determine whether any of these elections would be available and, if so, what the consequences of the alternative
        treatments would be in their particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should note, however, that the Company does not
        intend to comply with such reporting requirements necessary to permit U.S. Holders to elect to treat the Company as a
        qualified electing fund.
        16.2.3 Taxation of Distributions
        Distributions paid on Shares, other than certain pro rata distributions of Shares, will be treated as dividends to the extent
        paid out of the Company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax
        principles). To the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds the Company’s current and accumulated earnings
        and profits for a taxable year, the distribution will first be treated as a tax-free return of capital, causing a reduction in
        a U.S. Holder’s tax basis of common shares (but not below zero), and to the extent the amount of the distribution
        exceeds a U.S. Holder’s tax basis, the excess will be taxed as capital gain recognised on a sale or exchange. However,
        because the Company does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles,
        it is expected that distributions in their entirety generally will be reported to U.S. Holders as dividends. Subject to
        applicable limitations, dividends paid to certain non-corporate U.S. Holders may be classified as "qualified dividend
        income" and be taxable at a rate lower than the rates applicable to ordinary income. U.S. Holders should consult their
        tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced tax rate on dividends in their particular circumstances.
        The amount of a dividend will include any amounts withheld by the Company in respect of Norwegian withholding taxes.
        The amount of the dividend will be treated as foreign-source dividend income to U.S. Holders and will not be eligible for
        the dividends-received deduction generally available to U.S. corporations under the Code. Dividends will be included in
        a U.S. Holder’s income on the date of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of the dividend. The amount of any dividend income paid
        in NOK will generally be the U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of
        receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. If the dividend is converted into U.S.
        dollars on the date of receipt, a U.S. Holder should not be required to recognise foreign currency gain or loss in respect
        of the dividend income. A U.S. Holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars
        after the date of receipt, and any such gain or loss will be U.S.-source ordinary income or loss.
        Subject to applicable limitations, some of which vary depending upon the U.S. Holder’s circumstances, Norwegian taxes
        withheld from dividends on Shares (at a rate not exceeding the Treaty rate for U.S. Holders entitled for Treaty benefits)
        may be creditable against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. Dividends paid by the Company on the
        shares will generally constitute "passive category income" or in certain cases "general category income" for foreign tax
        credit purposes. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex, and U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors
        regarding the creditability of foreign taxes in their particular circumstances or the ability to deduct foreign taxes in lieu
        of claiming a foreign tax credit and any applicable limitations.
        16.2.4 Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Shares
        For U.S. federal income tax purposes, gain or loss realised on the sale or other disposition of Shares will be capital gain
        or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Shares for more than one year. The amount
        of the gain or loss will equal the difference between the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Shares disposed of and
        the amount realised on the disposition, in each case as determined in U.S. dollars. This gain or loss will generally be
                                        108
