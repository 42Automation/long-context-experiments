            the               CEO

            LINK celebrated the one-year milestone of our public listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange by
            establishing ourselves as a rapidly growing, global communication-platform-as-a-service
            (CPaaS) player gaining market recognition in 2021. The digitalization of our economies and the
            focus on seamless customer experience along with new ways of working in so many industries
            increased use cases for mobile messaging, and LINK continued to push the envelope to deliver
            increasingly relevant products and services for all our customers.    
            In addition to expanding the footprint in Europe, LINK distinguished itself this past year by
            entering the U.S. market via the acquisition of Message Broadcast, a leading provider of
            mission-critical customer engagement solutions to blue chip enterprise customers. This was
            one of six acquisitions closed in 2021 that delivered on our targeted M&A strategy outlined in
            greater detail later in this report.                                  
            On the commercial front, we launched our new LINK Partner Community that focuses on
            providing the technology, software, and integrations to continually enhance customer value.
            Business-critical integrations now provide massive potential in partner sales for years to come.
            Two major deals were Salesforce Marketing Cloud, where LINK is now part of the Salesforce
            Journey Builder to deliver both SMS and rich landing pages, and Emarsys, the SAP company
            empowering digital marketing leaders and business owners with its popular omnichannel
            customer engagement platform.                                         
                                                                                  
            Our completed integrations, 1,785 new signed business opportunities driving total gross
            margin, and expansion geographically and in product offerings shined an industry light on
            LINK. We were thrilled to be ranked as an established leader in Juniper Research’s 2021 CPaaS
            Competitor Leaderboard, a major indicator in our journey towards becoming a global forerunner
            in this emerging technology.                                          
            In early February 2022, we rose above a record number of competitors when Juniper yet again
            acknowledged our contributions to the industry by awarding LINK the “Best RCS Provider”
            Platinum title in the Telco Innovation category of the 2022 Future Digital Awards. This was due
            to our innovative Rich Communication Services (RCS) product which is positioned to make a
            significant impact for global brands in promotional and transactional messaging.
            Success and public recognition carry great responsibility for an organization. We have joined the
            world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative by signing the United Nations Global Compact,
            committing to aligning LINK’s strategies and operations with Ten Principles on human rights,
            labor, environment, and anti-corruption. Within social governance, LINK was one of 40 founding
            companies to make the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Pledge as part of the CEO Commitment,
            demonstrating that we value diversity as a lever for innovation, development, and profitability.
            For 2022, we have added a focus on environmental sustainability and created the first role
            within LINK that is fully dedicated to our ESG efforts, which is of vital importance as the world
            faces escalating humanitarian and climate crises.                     
                                                                                  
            We have strong aspirations for our CPaaS product development and market positioning in the
            coming year and will work together as a united, dedicated, and enthusiastic team, with an eye on
            environmental and social responsibility, to deliver for our employees and customers around the
            world.

            LINK has been operating in the digital messaging industry for two decades. When the company
            was founded in Norway more than 20 years ago, short message service (SMS) from person-to-
            person (P2P) was well established, while application-to-person (A2P) SMS was just emerging.
                                                                                  
            LINK was instrumental in driving the development of the A2P market in Norway throughout
            the 2000s, which today is the most penetrated and mature A2P SMS messaging market in the
            world. From its foothold in Norway, LINK first expanded in Scandinavia, then throughout Europe
            from 2016, and to the U.S. in 2021. LINK is now the clear market leader for enterprise mobile
            digital messaging in Europe with a foothold in the U.S. for further growth.

            A2P messaging is any type of messaging traffic sent by an application rather than another
            person. With enterprises and governments sending billions of A2P messaging traffic in Europe
            alone, mobile users will recognize both notifications and marketing types of messages.

            A2P messaging includes but is not limited to marketing communication, notifications,
            reminders, chatbots, and one-time-passwords (OTP). The importance of digital messaging has
            naturally and exponentially grown with the increased penetration of mobile phones.
                                                                                  
            A2P SMS messaging traffic utilizes local and global telecommunications networks. To
            deliver A2P SMS messages, LINK orchestrates these SMS messages sent by enterprises or
            governments through relevant telecom operator networks to the end users. Therefore, the
            telecom operators are channel suppliers to LINK.                      
            Until the shift from mobile phones to smart phones about 10 years ago, telecom networks were
            the only mobile digital messaging channel. However, with the rise of new internet-based mobile
            third-party messaging apps a multitude of new digital messaging possibilities have arisen.
            WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Viber and many other over-the-top (OTT) channels
            are now the preferred way to communicate for many people. OTT refers to internet streamed
            content, historically devices that go “over-the-top” of the cable TV box.

            These new channels provide vast new opportunities for digital communication, but also greatly
            increase complexity for enterprises and governments. Orchestration is no longer just between
            telecom operators, but in addition the multitude of new internet-based, third-party messaging
            app companies. This emerging market landscape over the past 10 years has given rise to a new
            industry, communication-platform-as-a-service (CPaaS), to manage the complexity and facilitate
            the opportunities these new technologies present.                     
            While standard SMS is limited to 160 characters in black and white, the new OTT channels have
            introduced full rich media experiences including images, videos, group chats, and interactions
            that smartphone users now take for granted in their person-to-person (P2P) communication
            with friends and family.                                              
                                                                                  
            Enterprises and governments are therefore pushed to embrace newer rich media
            communication to meet more demanding customer expectations. Simultaneously they are
            experimenting with the newer rich media communication capabilities to increase engagement,
            conversations, customer satisfaction, and overall return on communication investment.

            The telecommunication operators meanwhile are not standing still. They are taking steps to
            maintain relevance in the A2P messaging market and prevent the OTT third party messaging
            companies from gaining market share in the USD 60 billion global A2P messaging market.
            This market dynamic is driving the telecommunication companies’ investment in Rich
            Communication Services (RCS), sometimes nicknamed SMS 2.0. RCS has been rolled out by
            telecommunication operators in dozens of European countries and hundreds of operators
            worldwide. RCS offers similar features to the new OTT channels but is orchestrated via the
            telecommunication operator data networks to Android mobile devices.   
                                                                                  
            OTT and RCS have made digital messaging much more colorful and interesting. Richer
            content gives more user engagement. Engaged customers purchase more and are more loyal.
            Enterprises and governments increasingly see the importance of investing in a broader range of
            digital messaging solutions. The CPaaS industry is perfectly positioned to deliver these new and
            mature solutions as a single communications partner for enterprises and governments.
            The new and colorful OTT and RCS solutions are just emerging for business purposes and are
            still a relatively small percentage of total volume when compared to SMS. The vast opportunities
            they represent, however, indicate why analysts have identified CPaaS as a rapid growth industry
            in the coming years.                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            Gartner projects the API-enabled CPaaS market to grow with a          
            CAGR  of 28.1% in the 2020-2025 time frame. Global expansion

            market growth. Key technology areas driving growth are A2P            
            messaging, video and messaging apps.                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            Not to be left out, traditional A2P SMS messaging has also evolved during the last two decades
            to extend value and compete with these emerging technologies by including in the SMS an
            internet URL link to a landing page with rich content in mature markets like northern Europe.
            Advanced digital messaging solutions are therefore more adopted than the still relatively low
            OTT and RCS volumes would indicate.                                   
            Without doubt, the emerging CPaaS technologies will allow for seamless digital messaging
            communication, establishing two-way conversational messaging over the end users’ preferred
            channels and will become the de facto standard for enterprise and government interactions with
            customers and citizens.

            overview                                                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            Because every communication matters, LINK constantly enhances how messages are delivered
            and conversations are created for our customers.                      
                                                                                  
            All customer communications, from the simplest one-way messages to rich conversations,
            must bring real value. The communication needs to be carried and delivered in the most
            appropriate channel depending on the type of message, profile and preference of the customer,
            and location or device. Such communication can also be omnichannel in the sense of enabling
            continuous communication across several channels.                     
            At the heart of LINK’s strategy is our continuous effort to offer enterprises and governments
            communication solutions that increase customer engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty. By
            implementing our solutions, companies can greatly improve their customer satisfaction.
                                                                                  
            From a history of being the leading enterprise business application-to-person (A2P) provider
            in Europe, focusing on one-way ubiquitous communication, LINK has evolved its strategy to
            become a worldwide communication-platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) provider. This omnichannel
            shift was the result of an extensive strategy process during 2020, further revised and refined
            during 2021.                                                          
                                                                                  
            In our renewed strategy, we have maintained the enterprise customer focus. We cover the
            requirements and needs of large corporations and multinationals, typically offering our solutions
            for worldwide deployment. We also serve large and medium enterprises as well as governments
            through dedicated sales teams at 30 sales branches. The needs of smaller enterprises are
            covered through multiple Self Sign-Up (SSU) portals, where onboarding can be done in minutes
            with off-the-shelf product offerings.                                 
            LINK’s go-to-market (GTM) includes an extensive partner strategy, enabling our partners to
            embed LINK solutions in their own product offerings. From independent software vendors to
            large-scale software integration providers, resellers, and telecommunication operators, the LINK
            Partner Community has now grown to more than 750 partners.            
                                                                                  
            Local market presence has always been and continues to be part of LINK’s DNA. We are
            strengthening our local sales teams within enterprise and partner sales to ensure we fully
            understand the needs of our customers in each market. Additionally, we support local product
            adaptation/development where needed, and we provide local first line customer support in our
            customers’ preferred language. Local presence in combination with advanced CPaaS solutions
            tuned to the needs of each enterprise customer improves loyalty and net retention rates while
            minimizing churn.

            M&A is an important part of LINK ’s growth history and continues to be a key vehicle in
            achieving our strategic targets. Acquisitions serve different purposes, including being an
            effective tool for acquiring key products or capabilities, expanding into new geographies, or
            achieving scale in existing markets.                                  
                                                                                  
            During 2021, LINK started an international expansion beyond Europe. The acquisition of U.S.-
            based Message Broadcast is the first step in our ambitious international expansion.
            As a result of LINK ’s strategy to become a major CPaaS player, we are aggressively rolling
            out extensive omnichannel and conversational offerings. We have also started to strengthen
            additional channels such as voice and email. In Mobile Messaging, we are completing the
            rollout of Rich Communication Services (RCS) across our footprint, and LINK is already covering
            more than 16 mobile messaging channels.                               
                                                                                  
            LINK’s customers access our message channels and services through our extensive API
            offering as well as through our unique software offering, covering a wide range of use cases.
            For instance, we enable customers to build RCS campaigns towards their opted-in customer
            base, delivering the campaign through a richer channel which results in higher response rates.
            We also offer advanced software to support our customers in segmenting their customer base
            and tailoring the right communication messages.                       
                                                                                  
            LINK’s solutions and software enable our customers to deliver excellent customer service
            every day, increase fraud prevention, and provide account verification. As an example, we are
            implementing omnichannel customer care solutions, enabling end-users to obtain support
            through their preferred channel. As customers change their behaviors, LINK is constantly
            adapting and enhancing how messages are delivered and conversations are created.

            LINK has a distinct M&A strategy and proven track record in creating value beyond its organic
            growth. Since 2014, LINK has completed 31 acquisitions, including seven since the initial public
            offering (IPO) in October 2020, to become the clear market leader for enterprise messaging
            solutions in Europe. Last year, LINK expanded outside Europe for the first time with the
            acquisition of Message Broadcast in the U.S. The new overseas foothold provides opportunity
            for additional expansion in the low penetrated, high growth, and high margin U.S. market. In
            addition to the U.S. expansion, LINK completed five acquisitions in Europe during 2021, further
            consolidating its market leader position and adding new product capabilities.
                                                                                  
            The distinct M&A strategy drives value through acquisitions of companies that advance LINK’s
            core business. Execution of the strategy follows a three-pillar approach depending on the type
            of acquisition target. Add-on or tuck-in acquisitions aim to increase the customer base and
            grow market share in local markets. Level-up cases refer to acquisitions of larger companies
            to gain access to new markets. Solutions acquisitions are defined as acquisitions of innovative
            software products to provide upselling opportunities across LINK’s large customer base.

            The M&A process follows a clear path from target identification through to integration and
            realization of synergies. To find the strategically most suitable targets, LINK runs a proprietary
            screening process that assesses the target’s technical platform, business performance,
            and CPaaS capabilities. Targets considered suitable for acquisition by LINK must be either
            technically advanced or established and profitable with a very low customer churn. During
            2021, a more structured manner of integrating newly acquired companies was implemented, in
            which the primary focus was operational efficiency and internal alignment. By establishing this
            process, more time is allowed for focusing on commercial and product strategies for driving
            LINK’s growth in the short and long term. Through boosting operational efficiency, we allow for
            reduced operating expenses (OPEX) and lower cost of goods sold (COGS) while also taking
            away many of the operational and administrative burdens the company may have experienced
            before they became a part of the group.

            LINK first expanded outside Scandinavia in 2016 with the acquisition of WhateverMobile, a
            leading messaging provider in Germany. Since the acquisition, LINK has significantly increased
            the scale of the business by leveraging its advanced product portfolio and improved operational
            efficiency through best practices. Notably, DHL Express was onboarded, and gross margins
            increased through routing efficiencies. The acquisition shows LINK’s ability to drive growth by
            combining industry and market knowledge with branding and financial expertise.

            LINK entered the French market in 2019 by acquiring Netsize, a leading enterprise focused
            A2P player. At the time, Netsize had struggled with flat or declining revenue and gross profits
            for years. The LINK integration rekindled growth through implementation of best practices
            and streamlining of operations. The efficiency gains improved the cost position and revenue
            synergies were realized through increased commercial effectiveness.

            LINK completed one level-up acquisition in 2021 with Message Broadcast, a leading provider
            of mission critical customer engagement solutions to large enterprise customers, in the U.S.
            The acquisition expanded LINK’s footprint beyond Europe and will significantly contribute to the
            organic growth and profitability of the group. Please refer to the separate “LINK expanding to

            LINK acquired WebSMS in Austria in October 2020 shortly after the IPO. WebSMS was and
            remains the leading messaging provider in Austria with significant additional business in the
            wider DACH region, including Germany and Switzerland. The acquisition consolidated LINK’s
            business activities in the region. WebSMS has delivered solid growth across all client segments
            and gained an increased foothold within healthcare and the public sectors since the acquisition.

            LINK focuses on three main go-to-market (GTM) strategies that allow for the acquisition of
            customers in an efficient way. The key to a successful GTM is applying the right tool for the job,
            ensuring the customer receives the right service with a frictionless experience to becoming
            a customer, onboarding, and using our services. GTM methodology drives revenue growth,
            reduces customer acquisition costs, and improves operational efficiencies

            LINK’s biggest customer acquisition funnel is through a localized enterprise salesforce. LINK
            employs well over 100 salespeople within our local markets, each with a standardized way of
            working and being well equipped with local knowledge of the peculiarities of that market. A
            key differentiator for LINK is to be local so we know our market and know our customers. This
            unique insight enables LINK to provide superior value and levels of service to customers.
                                                                                  
            As a result of the extraordinary growth of CPaaS for several global customer accounts, in 2021
            LINK increased focus and investments into its global sales initiatives, which primarily focus on
            large tech and logistics companies

            have been instrumental in the GTM success.                            
            In 2021, LINK launched a best-in-class

            LINK sees the adaptation of services being driven by three main use cases: Transactions or
            notifications, marketing, and customer experience. Each of these use cases has different
            growth drivers, and LINK’s efforts are continuously focused on these differences.
                                                                                  
            LINK’s largest share of traffic comes from transaction or notification use cases. Large industries
            applying these include banks and financial institutions, and logistics companies who are
            continuously communicating with their customers regarding delivery notifications, transactional
            messaging for notification purposes, and verification and authentication including one-time
            password (OTP) use cases. Vast growth in OTP volumes has been driven by large global tech
            companies. CPaaS will over time bring further value, a trend already evident for some of the
            notification use cases, with new features and functionality such as chatbots, web experience
            landing pages, and logics being implemented.

            The second most significant use case for LINK is marketing communications. In 2021,
            eCommerce-focused mobile messaging increased, especially among large retailers. Other
            growth use cases for marketing are the industries we see growing in a digital-only environment.
            Marketing is currently experiencing a boom with rich messaging optionality providing a rich
            experience through utilizing add-ons to the traditional SMS. LINK is in a good position to
            capitalize on this trend, with rich messaging now starting to come in many forms including Rich
            SMS, OTT channels, and RCS.                                           
                                                                                  
            LINK is currently working with several high-profile global brands that are using RCS for both
            promotional and transactional messaging. These messaging needs include promotional
            marketing, showcasing product catalogs with personalized shopping assistance, presenting
            new products, and making appointments or confirming orders and deliveries. LINK’s customers
            have experienced +400% increases in open rates, engagement scores, and click-through rates
            using RCS in comparison to the same campaigns on other channels.

            Thirdly, the customer experience area is, over time, an area where CPaaS providers will have
            much to gain. CPaaS and CCaaS solutions provide a naturally good fit. LINK has mainly
            partnered with leading players in this space, building established partnerships inside CCaaS.
            These solutions come in various shapes and forms but almost all of them rely on a CPaaS
            vendor in an environment where customers become more and more channel-agnostic, with an
            omnichannel strategy allowing them to choose different channels depending on the customer
            preferences and experience.

            The A2P messaging and CPaaS industries are continuously evolving with new technologies
            enabling more advanced use cases. LINK develops products and solutions in readiness to these
            new market opportunities and currently drives digitalization with a product offering ahead of
            customers’ expectations.                                              
                                                                                  
            Innovation in the industry is typically led by large global customers’ adoption of CPaaS
            solutions and adaptation to their specific needs. Enterprises and governments in general adopt
            technology and improve their services more incrementally. LINK is in this context seen as a
            key strategic partner, and combined with its extensive local presence, attracts strong customer
            relationships in developing innovative new CPaaS solutions. By delivering and enabling new
            CPaaS use cases for customers, LINK helps to accelerate the digitalization of business
            processes. The transition to more advanced CPaaS solutions provides additional SaaS license
            revenue for LINK on top of messaging volume revenue from A2P SMS.     
            Reflecting LINK’s continuous development of A2P messaging and innovative CPaaS
            implementations, Juniper Research in 2021 positioned LINK as a leading CPaaS player. In this

            Demonstrating the lead in innovation, LINK won the 2022 Platinum Award for the “Best RCS
            provider” in the CPaaS industry. In the emerging RCS market, LINK has invested to take a market
            leader position for global RCS capabilities on GSMA standards, with integrated RCS NLP/AI
            chatbots for marketing automation, customer care, and notification traffic.
            LINK took a position in the NLP/AI chatbot industry through the acquisition of the Xenioo
            conversational platform in 2021. This industry segment is estimated to grow from a total value
            of USD 20 billion in 2021 to USD 100 billion in 2026, according to Mordor Intelligence. The broad
            application of chatbots across the super use cases, notification, marketing, and customer care
            are seen as drivers of that growth.                                   
            Expanding further from LINK’s A2P messaging roots, planned expansion and acquisition of
            voice and video capabilities will unlock new addressable markets, use cases, and revenue
            streams from new and existing customers. As Europe’s leading digital messaging company
            with a foothold in the U.S., award winning CPaaS solutions, and a leading product development
            portfolio, LINK is positioned as a key player and contributor in the ever-advancing digital

            LINK’s board of directors has adopted a policy to reflect the company’s commitment to integrate
            environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) factors into its daily operations and as
            a part of its strategic processes. The board has considered these topics in relation to LINK’s
            business operations and reviewed factors based on the UN Sustainable Development Goals
            (SDGs), the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
            Enterprises.                                                          
                                                                                  
            In 2021, LINK confirmed it committed to integrating the Ten           
            Principles of the UN Global Compact in its operations by becoming     
            a signatory. In line with the UN Global Compact, LINK is committed    
            to continuously progress in the four focus areas: Anti-Corruption,    
            Human Rights, Environment & Labor.                                    
                                                                                  
            Our Sustainability report shows the key actions that we have          
            implemented in these areas in 2021 and our ambitions for 2022. The    
            report is published in accordance with the EU non-financial reporting 
            directive and the Norwegian Accounting Act Section 3-3C.

            As the global understanding of ESG as important factors affecting businesses across markets
            and industries gain ground, it is crucial for any business to understand and manage the risks
            and opportunities related to these topics, not only when making strategic decisions but also in
            its daily operations.                                                 
                                                                                  
            In a context that is constantly evolving, LINK recognizes that the areas affected by ESG factors
            may vary over time. The topics listed below are the material risks and opportunities as identified
            during the last accounting year. The process of identification involved key department experts
            as well as other internal stakeholder such as the board members and employees.

            The topics listed below are material for LINK as we believe we can have a positive impact on
            these factors. Our workforce is at the heart of our company, and we believe in growing together
            with our employees by empowering them.

            LINK aims to have representation from all sections of society and for each employee to
            feel respected so they can perform at their best. At LINK, we do not tolerate any kind of
            discrimination based on origin, religion, gender or sexual orientation, state of health and/or
            disability, political opinions, religious beliefs, or family status. These values are clearly stated in
            our Code of Conduct and upheld in our daily actions.

            Our permanent and freelance contract workforce combined has 66% male and 34% female
            representation, which exceeds the technology industry average reporting in 2021. We do
            not have any employees who self-designate as any other gender currently, but the option is
            available to all. Our greatest areas for representative improvement are in our Global Leadership
            Team (GLT) and Extended Leadership Team (ELT), where women made up 25% and 22% of the
            leadership groups in 2021, respectively.

            In 2021, LINK implemented an organization-wide human resources and employment position
            categorization system which was required to gain a clear understanding of our worldwide
            workforce and connect our operations. With this system, we have been able to take the first
            steps toward quantitative data mapping on gender representation and compensation. We aim to
            have an actionable analysis of the gender pay gap at LINK completed in 2022.

            Gender pay equality: The unadjusted gender pay gap for 2021 is 13.6%. The rate shows the
            difference between average male salaries over average female salaries in percent, irrespective
            of other variables, such as position level. The gender pay gap analysis refers to the workforce in
            Norway.                                                               
            Parental leave: In 2021, the average number of days of parental leave for women was 121 days
            and for men was 48.5 days. The scope of this analysis is the workforce in Norway.

            Our recruitment process includes new policy guidelines including strategies and hiring manager
            training to attract more diverse candidates, with an emphasis on women, across all levels
            of responsibility in the organization. LINK was an early signatory of the CEO Commitment’s
            Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Pledge, vowing to set diversity and inclusion as an integrated and
            strategic priority in our organization that is anchored in our top management.

            LINK had operations in 19 countries in 2021, consisting of European nations and the U.S.
            National identification is optional based on office, but we know of 29 reported nationalities at
            LINK representing five of the seven continents of the world. Our global headquarters in Oslo has
            employees representing 12 different nationalities.                    
                                                                                  
            To accommodate our multinational workforce and foster an inclusive environment, the entire
            organization participated in an interactive workshop on cultural differences and cross-country
            collaboration in June 2021. This initiative is discussed in further detail under Employee
            Engagement in this report.

            LINK does not tolerate discrimination of any kind based on state of health and/or disability,
            and we offer accommodation wherever possible to ensure a quality work environment for all
            employees. We currently have employees who self-report as working with a disability.
                                                                                  
            Our ambitions for 2022                                                
                                                                                  
            In 2022, LINK plans to conduct a detailed analysis of gender representation, compensation, and
            benefits to more clearly measure and identify opportunities to increase diversity and narrow the
            gender pay gap. The goal is to have a strategy in place to support this ambition by 2023 using

            Employee engagement – Making LINK a better place to work              
                                                                                  
            Remaining united with high employee engagement is an integral part of LINK’s values and
            company culture even as we grow and add new affiliates each year. We hold several monthly,
            bimonthly, quarterly, and annual events to keep our employees informed about the latest
            developments and to present the results of our cooperative dedication.
                                                                                  
            LINK Days                                                             
            We held our company-wide virtual gathering, called LINK Days, over two and a half days in
            June 2021. The goal of this event was to bring LINKers from around the world together to
            interact across country and department lines. One of the main themes for LINK Days 2021 was
            cultural differences and cross-country collaboration. We engaged an external speaker with
            expertise in bridging cultural differences to present new ways of working and interacting with
            awareness. LINKers used this new learning in break-out workshops on cross-country teamwork
            to discuss cross-cultural communication and challenges. They also reviewed what the LINK
            values – united, dedicated, and enthusiastic – mean in different cultures across all countries.
            Through this exercise, we examined our current and desired LINK culture, identifying gaps for
            improvement.

            All Hands meetings are organized at the group, regional, and local levels for employees on
            regular schedules. These meetings are used to share business updates from the past months,
            celebrate milestones and new arrivals, and offer employees the opportunity to ask questions.

            One department that continually innovates and develops new products and cases is Group
            Product. To keep all LINKers informed, this team also organizes optional bimonthly information
            sessions to showcase developments concerning LINK’s products.

            Twice per year, we conduct a company-wide survey for all LINKers to express satisfaction or
            areas for improvement across a spectrum of issues. The LINK Voice survey is critical to gauging
            our employee engagement and overall satisfaction, and managers also use the results to guide
            decision-making in their departments.

            LINK’s strategic vision for 2025 includes securing an employee engagement score of 75 on the
            LINK Voice survey conducted through the Culture Amp® platform, as we seek to be a highly
            desirable workplace in our industry. For the concluding LINK Voice of 2021, we experienced
            an all-time high participation rate of 92% across the company (exceeding the Culture Amp®
            industry benchmark of 83%) and an employee engagement score of 65. This score trails the
            technology Europe benchmark of 71 by 6 points, but this was a marked improvement for LINK
            over the 10-point difference in our score and the Culture Amp® industry benchmark one year
            earlier in 2020. We aim to close the gap even further in 2022 as we steadily progress in our
            multi-year strategic plan.

            During 2021, LINK refreshed internal training on topics related to Personal Data Protection,
            Compliance, and Information Security. Each employee is required to complete the training on a
            yearly basis.

            In 2021, LINK reviewed and published updated guidelines related to personal data protection
            including Privacy by Design Guidelines and Data Breach Policies, and delivered company-wide
            training on the topic. To help identify and minimize the data protection risks of a project, LINK
            has made available a refreshed Data Protection Impact Assessment handbook and Privacy by
            Design Guidelines that are available to all employees.                
                                                                                  
            Focus on personal data protection and privacy compliance in new affiliates
            By 2021 all companies that were acquired by LINK before 2021 have approved and are in
            process of adopting the Personal Data Protection Policy directly and/or have implemented the
            policy or equivalent policies that are accepted by LINK as evidenced by the yearly audit process.
            Furthermore, LINK will send its first application for Binding Corporate Rules for its processing
            as Processor and as Controller under the GDPR article 47, which will significantly improve the
            transparency of LINK’s processes to comply with the GDPR.

            LINK is going beyond the initial GDPR Project and since 2018 focused on mitigation of the initial
            customer privacy and data protection risks and has put in place a continuous improvement
            process focused on the following areas

            In 2022, we would like to prioritize data retention and increase the automation of data deletion
            processes. Roadmaps and action plans have been laid down by internal and business IT teams
            to focus on data retention in business IT systems

            Managing access to critical systems is a priority for LINK in 2022 and several measures will be
            implemented in the next couple of years to gain a better ability for managing access.

            To ensure that all managers and employees commit to operating consistently with the UN
            Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Ten Principles of the UN Global
            Compact, LINK has implemented the following measures                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            Employee code of conduct                                              
            The values of human rights that we promote can be found in our Employee Code of Conduct
            signed by all new employees. Our code of conduct clearly states that we
                                                                                  
            y Oppose all forms of forced labor and child labor in our operations  
            y Report on any human rights abuse in our operations or in those of our business partners

            Environment and climate change                                        
            LINK is aware of the environmental impact of its operations. In this regard, the material topics
            for LINK are energy management, climate change, and material use. As a business with high
            requirements for data storage, LINK can reduce our impact in several ways by implementing
            measures directly in its operations. LINK chooses well recognized international hosting
            providers that have efficient energy management systems in place. LINK goes beyond its direct
            impact on GHG emission and looks to contribute to global reduction of emissions. We can do so
            by helping customers reduce emissions from their operations.          
                                                                                  
            In addition to working on our direct operations, it is our responsibility to educate our employees
            about environmental issues. In 2021, there were several actions carried out to raise awareness
            about this topic:

                The LINK Days is a digital company-wide gathering bringing together employees from
                all affiliates to announce results and future strategy. One of the focus topics of the 2021
                edition was innovation and sustainability. Sylvija Seres, an expert on these two topics,
                presented and shared knowledge with all employees all about how we can balance
                the triple bottom line: people, profit, and planet. She discussed how innovation and
                sustainability are things that everyone can take part of and aren’t just dedicated to one
                day a year – they are meant to be a part of our day-to-day lives.

                This talk led to another workshop: our employees were brought together to work in
                teams to find creative ways for LINK to be more environmentally friendly. The solutions
                proposed by our employees ranged from measures to improve direct emissions to
                working on our products to help our customers meet their climate goals.
                                                                                  
                After the LINK Days, to kick-off our dedication to climate action, LINK signed up for
                Challengize, a social platform for health and team building where companies can track
                employee teams and their workouts. We encouraged all employees to get out and
                exercise for an hour and a half during one of the LINK Days as part of the challenge to
                raise money. In just this short time, we raised 10,000 euros. The money raised through
                our LINK Challenge for Climate Action, was donated to a European NGO that works to
                preserve and restore forests around the world.                    
            Even though groupwide operations will be implemented in 2022, some of LINK’s subsidiaries are
            precursors in the domain of climate change. Our affiliates in the DACH region are one of these
            examples.                                                             
                                                                                  
                B. Climate action in the DACH region                              
                                                                                  
                In 2021, with the help of external consultants specialized in sustainability transformation,
                LINK Mobility Austria and Germany implemented a comprehensive carbon footprint
                assessment. This carbon footprint covered Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions which totalled to
                328 tCO2. Emissions related to mobility contributed to 50% of the total carbon footprint.
                                                                                  
                Having assessed its carbon footprint in the last accounting year, in 2022, the DACH
                region will appoint a sustainability officer to implement measures to reduce to its carbon
                footprint, to name a few:

                y Purchasing nuclear-free low carbon electricity                  
                y Selecting server hosting partners with carbon assessments and reduction measures
                                                                                  
                y Switching to sustainable certified provision fund for employees in Austria
                                                                                  
                For areas in which direct emission reductions are not possible, globally standardized
                climate protection projects will be supported using carbon compensation. The next steps
                for LINK Austria and Germany are to assess the carbon footprint of its products and
                thereby help reduce their customers’ carbon footprint.

            LINK currently ensures that its providers can document their approach to energy efficiency and
            is in the process of implementing requirements towards its suppliers in procurement processes,
            and routines to document its assessments of providers. There are more details on this topic in

            With a business model that relies heavily on the use of IT infrastructure, we are aware that
            the materials used in manufacturing our IT infrastructure has an impact on the environment.
            The first step in evaluating the environmental impact of material and resource use will be
            implemented in 2022-203. This step consists of mapping of all IT equipment in data centers and
            offices.                                                              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            Our ambitions to reduce our environmental impact in 2022              
                                                                                  
            Energy consumption                                                    
                                                                                  
            To have a comprehensive idea of our energy consumption, LINK will assess primary energy and
            electricity consumption related directly to its operations. This assessment will allow LINK to
            understand its dependence on energy and electricity within our operations and will form a basis
            for the company to set future energy efficiency targets.              
                                                                                  
            Carbon footprint calculation                                          
            At LINK Mobility, we are aware that the first step to positively impacting climate issues
            is to evaluate our impact on the climate. Keeping this in mind and to begin its journey to
            positively contribute to climate change, LINK will calculate its GHG emission related to direct
            operations (Scope 1 & 2) using standard reporting frameworks such as GHG Protocol and
            ISO14064/14069.                                                       
                                                                                  
            Climate Risk assessment                                               
                                                                                  
            In 2022, we will start assessing transition and physical risks related to climate. Our objective
            is not only to identify our impact on the environment and more specifically climate change but
            also verify our business’ vulnerability to this topic.

            We feel that it is our responsibility to help create awareness on climate change for our
            employees. For this reason, in 2022, each of LINK’s affiliates will implement at least once action
            related to climate change in their local settings.

            Rapidly changing technology context                                   
            As part of an industry that is vulnerable to rapid technological change, with technology under
            constant development, and the market’s expectations for messaging services to follow the
            development, LINK strives towards adaptability to technological changes as part of its strategy.
            Strategy assessments are therefore made annually for LINK’s management to ensure a
            sufficient basis for setting its strategy to cope with changes in the industry. The assessments
            are a tool for measuring vulnerability going forward.                 
                                                                                  
            LINK’s focus on adaptability is seen through multiple areas of its business, hereunder
                                                                                  
            Development of new product offerings                                  
                                                                                  
            LINK’s strategy for product development is defined based on assessment of the market
            expectation and new developments, in order to ensure a product portfolio that is in line with
            technological development in the marketplace                          
                                                                                  
            Resilient infrastructure                                              
                                                                                  
            As a business highly dependent upon data storage, LINK maintains and develops its processes
            to ensure availability, cost efficiency, climate adaptation, and risk mitigation expected for a
            company of its size and geographical presence. Migration of server sites, assessment of
            carbon footprint, and secure redundancy are examples of such processes
                                                                                  
            Promotion of ESG as part of its business                              
            With the increased global understanding of Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance
            as important factors affecting business across markets and industries, it is crucial for any
            technology business to understand the effects on expectations for technology to meet and
            exceed requirements and make them part of strategic decisions and daily operations
                                                                                  
            Attraction and retention of skilled employees                         
                                                                                  
            A rapidly changing and complex industry requires the ability to attract and retain highly skilled
            employees. An important element of attracting and retaining skilled personnel is to retain its
            focus on diversity and inclusion as well as equal opportunities. Furthermore, a clear stand
            against harassment and intimidation, as well as focus on treating personnel with respect and
            tolerance are elements of importance for LINK’s ability to retain skilled personnel. LINK will
            continue to ensure that its procedures in this area are upheld and enforced.
                                                                                  
            In addition to the above, LINK’s core business of providing better digital communication for
            enterprises and governments directly forms part of how technological changes can improve and
            simplify processes in society.

            Bribery and corruption undermine any legitimate business operations and therefore is an area of
            focus at LINK. In line with its values, laws, and regulations governing all areas where it operates,
            LINK is putting into practice its commitment, as outlined in its Anti-Corruption Policy and Code
            of Conduct, to fight against corruption in all its forms, by gradually introducing a comprehensive
            anti-corruption system.                                               
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy                               
            LINK is committed to observe the laws and regulations that govern our operations wherever it
            operates. Compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws is of key importance to all of
            LINK’s businesses.                                                    
                                                                                  
            Employee Code of Conduct                                              
                                                                                  
            At LINK, we do not tolerate corruption in any form, including bribery, facilitation payments, and
            trading in influence. Our employee code of conduct clearly states our commitment to anti-
            corruption in business practices                                      
                                                                                  
            Supplier Code of conduct                                              
                                                                                  
            One of the focus areas of our Supplier Due Diligence process that was put in place in 2021, is
            Anti-corruption. Like our Employee Code of Conduct, our Supplier Code of conduct states our
            non-tolerance of corruption in the context of our suppliers.

            All LINK Mobility’s employees and contractors complete an annual training program covering
            areas of key importance to perform their work at LINK. Anti-Corruption is one of the areas where
            all employees are measured annually. LINK’s board of directors decided from the year 2022 to
            ensure incentives for completion of the program and approved completion as a KPI for bonus
            achievement for LINK employees.                                       
                                                                                  
            A global whistleblowing system                                        
            LINK’s current whistleblowing system was set up in May 2021 and is available to all LINK
            affiliates. It allows all employees, as well as external and temporary employees, to issue an alert
            securely and confidentially via an outsourced internet platform. These reports can relate to acts
            of corruption or other ethical issues (environment, security, fraud, personal data, human rights,
            etc.) and, more generally speaking, to any situation or conduct that may be contrary to the Code
            of Conduct. The overall system architecture was designed to provide a means of filing these

            Suppliers’ assessment - The supplier due diligence process at LINK    
            LINK has committed to avoid causing adverse impacts on people, the environment, and society
            in its daily operations, as well as to avoid contributing to such adverse impacts within its
            relations with stakeholders, including suppliers.                     
                                                                                  
            LINK depends on several suppliers, including entities operating in the telecommunication
            industry (mobile network operators (MNO), aggregators, and over-the-top (OTT) providers),
            certain IT vendors (hosting, server and storage solution providers, software vendors), as well as
            a variety of other supply-side partners.                              
                                                                                  
            LINK has taken up certain actions aimed at identifying and organizing its relations with
            suppliers, enabling the company to act responsibly and to create added value throughout its
            value chain. In 2021, LINK has introduced a basic supplier-due-diligence (SDD) process, based
            on the methodology proposed by OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business
            Conduct. The focus areas for LINK Mobility in supplier assessment are

            In 2021, the supplier assessment process has included suppliers’ mapping, risk assessment,
            and proposal of mitigation measures. After having mapped the entirety of its suppliers, LINK has
            implemented the following measures                                    
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            Supplier and Employee Code of Conduct                                 
            Embedding LINK core values into corporate policies and subsequently developing relevant
            codes of conduct has been a first step in raising employees’ and stakeholders’ awareness.
            Introduced in 2021, our codes of conduct convey a clear message of LINK’s expectations
            within areas covered by ESG, anti-corruption, competition, and privacy policies, and hence, they
            contribute to improving sustainability through LINK’s value chain.    
                                                                                  
            Employees training                                                    
                                                                                  
            Compliance training is a measure of raising employees’ awareness of various compliance
            issues, including the required conduct towards third parties. Privacy training (GDPR and IT
            security) has been obligatory for all LINK employees for several years now, and in 2021 the
            company additionally launched a general compliance training, covering sustainability, anti-
            corruption, and competition policies. All new employees are expected to complete both training
            courses upon commencement of their employment at LINK and subsequently every year.
                                                                                  
            Privacy/ IT security questionnaires                                   
                                                                                  
            The questionnaires are aimed at mitigating risks related to the processing of personal data in
            vendors’ systems. LINK has used questionnaires for several years now.

            Our 2022 ambitions                                                    
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            To continue our efforts to reduce risks associated with suppliers, the following measures will be
            implemented in 2022.                                                  
                                                                                  
            Increasing the scope of suppliers                                     
                                                                                  
            In 2021 the suppliers’ mapping covered telecommunication vendors. In 2022, LINK will increase
            its supplier assessment scope to certain IT suppliers.                
                                                                                  
            SDD questionnaire                                                     
            The general SDD questionnaire, developed in 2021, is expected to act as a primary guidance
            tool during the SDD process in 2022. The questionnaire has been identified as an effective tool
            to raise employees’ awareness of compliance issues, and to collect relevant knowledge on
            suppliers’ entities.                                                  
                                                                                  
            Contract measures                                                     
                                                                                  
            LINK expects its suppliers to adhere to standards set out in the Supplier Code of Conduct and it
            will therefore introduce relevant clauses in the supplier contracts.

            Audits have been identified as an effective tool for periodical evaluation of the actual
            performance against corporate policies. Internal audits relevant to the implementation of
            supplier assessment measures will be introduced in 2022.              
                                                                                  
            Environment clauses                                                   
                                                                                  
            In 2022, material environmental issues will be analyzed with respect to suppliers.
                                                                                  
            IT security                                                           
            LINK believes that information security is not a one-time exercise, but a continuous effort.
            All of our digital channels serve a business purpose. To assure that the assets we provide to
            customers are safe to use, we employ a standardized approach to information security, from
            both internal and external vectors. LINK is currently in the process of obtaining ISO 270001
            compliance for its major software portfolio lines. One main policy regarding IT Security has
            been implemented.                                                     
                                                                                  
            Information Security Policy                                           
                                                                                  
            The Information Security Policy is an overarching document that contains all major directions,
            as well as several sub-policies. The overall guidelines to follow are based on ISO 27K
            frameworks, as well as GDPR.

            There are two prevalent approaches that are being instilled in our daily development and
            processing workflows. Privacy by design and zero trust. The purpose of the security policy
            is to establish a framework for the protection of information at LINK and all subsidiaries,
            so that critical or sensitive information and systems preserve their confidentiality, integrity,
            and availability. It is the policy to permit the use, access, and disclosure of information in
            accordance with the company’s guidelines and with due regard to applicable laws at any
            time. Based on risk assessment, the company establishes a level of safety that corresponds
            to the importance of the information in question. LINK carries out frequent risk assessments
            to determine the current “threatscape” and subsequently react based on the final evaluation.
            The document also describes the security strategy, which consists of elements such as
            responsibilities and organizational levels, training, collection, and management of information,
            etc. The Information Security Policy document is updated on a regular basis, and it is approved
            by the top-level management of the company, preceded by a wide review of specialists.

            years leveraged its knowledge and capabilities throughout Europe to become the clear market
            leader within enterprise mobile messaging solutions. Including the new foothold in the U.S.,
            LINK is uniquely positioned to benefit from the increased usage of mobile messaging solutions
            globally.                                                             
                                                                                  
            Market position and development                                       
                                                                                  
            The overall market trend towards digital conversations continued through 2021. The new
            channels with richer content and conversational features, RCS (SMS 2.0) and OTT (internet
            streaming) are increasingly a required addition to the core SMS product. Multichannel and
            conversational solutions are the definition of communication-platform-as-a-service (CPaaS).
            The market growth is driven by a broader adoption of digital messaging from private companies,
            public services, and organizations as a central part of their communication strategy. In 2021,
            LINK sent 14.4 billion messages (including the full-year effect of acquired entities), compared to
            10.7 billion messages the previous year, on behalf of its 47 200 (40 600) customers. The market
            for mobile messaging solutions is expected to continue to expand with the vast opportunities
            presented by new CPaaS solutions.                                     
            LINK has an exceptionally low customer churn (2% in 2021) securing recurring and growing
            revenue from existing clients. Most customers increase their use of LINK’s mobile services and
            include more advanced solutions as they realize high returns on investment (ROI). ROI is driven
            by higher revenue from better communication with their end-users and lower costs through
            more efficient internal processes.                                    
                                                                                  
            LINK has a clearly stated twofold strategy for growth. The company drives organic growth
            through an increased market share in existing markets and enters new markets through
            acquisitions. M&A is also supportive to the product offering through acquisitions of solutions
            companies. Last year LINK acquired Timsi in the Netherlands (voice and number masking),
            MarketingPlatform in Denmark (email and customer data platform), and Xenioo in Italy
            (chatbot). The new solutions advance the CPaaS offering and create value for LINK’s large
            customer base.

            Organic growth in the various markets is supported by LINK’s unique threefold go-to-market
            (GTM) strategy. Larger enterprise customers are approached directly by dedicated salespeople,
            small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are acquired through self-sign-up (SSU) portals
            and the partner model expands the customer base and product offering. LINK delivers tailored
            CPaaS solutions to its enterprise customers. These tailored innovations are then standardized
            to SaaS solutions and offered through LINK’s SSU portals. Partners further scale the business
            as LINK solutions are sold to partner customers and partner applications are offered to LINK
            customers.                                                            
                                                                                  
            LINK’s extensive experience and a large customer base in the most innovative and advanced
            markets for digital messaging in the world give it a clear competitive advantage. The unique
            threefold GTM strategy provides scalability to the highly competitive business model.

            Net financial items amounted to a negative NOK 14 million (negative NOK 427 million due to a
            senior facility agreement (SFA) which was refinanced in December 2020) and constituted a net
            interest expense of NOK 128 million linked to an outstanding bond, net other financial expenses
            of NOK 13 million and a positive currency effect of NOK 100 million. LINK’s outstanding bond
            was issued at EUR 200 million in December 2020 to refinance the SFA and a tap issue of EUR
            170 million, related to the acquisition of Message Broadcast in the U.S., was completed in June
            2021. The bond carries a fixed coupon of 3.375% and matures in December 2025.
            Income tax was NOK 30 million (positive NOK 77 million), resulting in a net loss for LINK of NOK

            LINK’s cash flow from operating activities during 2021 was NOK 341 million (NOK 364 million)
            and significantly better than the net loss reported for the year mainly due to non-recurring costs
            with a limited cash effect and non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses. Cash flow
            from investing activities was NOK 2009 million (NOK 660 million) of which the acquisition of
            Message Broadcast in the U.S. in June 2021 was the main element. Cash flows from financing
            activities amounted to NOK 1 583 million (NOK 1 135 million), largely stemming from a tap
            issue of EUR 170 million in June 2021.

            The Group has defined six risk areas under which risks are identified that can prevent the
            successful implementation of LINK’s business strategy or manage its growth effectively. Market
            risk, financial risk, acquisition risk, IT risk, legal & compliance risk, and operational risk.
            The below section describes how the Global Leadership Team (GLT) evaluates and mitigates
            these risks and includes comments on the risks related to the global pandemic, and the
            geopolitical uncertainty that has evolved in 2022.                    
                                                                                  
            Market risk                                                           
                                                                                  
            LINK’s risks related to its customers and competition, hereunder loss of contracts and
            opportunities, are managed under the headline of market risk.         
                                                                                  
            LINK is operating in the CPaaS market which is transitioning from the A2P SMS market via
            multichannel offerings to omnichannel solutions. The evolution of SMS to RCS and new
            OTT options like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or Viber enables brands to communicate
            with their customers on many channels in a richer format. An omnichannel offering hands
            the channel choice to the customer as the brands facilitate all types of customer-originated
            communication.                                                        
                                                                                  
            The A2P SMS market has traditionally grown by more than 10% annually and continues to do so
            through adoption in new markets and industries and increased usage in more mature segments.
            As the new channel technologies offer vast new opportunities for value creation, the new CPaaS
            industry is likely to exhibit significant growth through an S-curve evolution in use cases. Before
            reaching critical mass, the CPaaS market will however be small in comparison to the more
            penetrated A2P SMS market. The timeline to reach critical mass remains uncertain and a risk
            for overall high growth in the industry. A channel-agnostic approach limits this risk for LINK as
            the company is versatile to adopt channels and solutions as they mature and gain traction in the
            market.

            Financial risk                                                        
                                                                                  
            LINK’s activities expose it to financial risks, such as price, currency, liquidity, interest rate, and
            credit. Overall, these risks are regarded as low and manageable.      
                                                                                  
            LINK’s revenue, costs, and profits are subject to the risk of changes in customer and supplier
            prices. As expected, some margin pressure is observed for simple use cases like one-time
            passwords (OTP), wholesale SMS, and basic mobile payment services. LINK is only to a limited
            degree exposed to simple use cases as the company’s strategy has always been towards
            enterprise solutions. This strategy results in a very low customer churn and growing recurring
            revenue. LINK did not experience material margin pressure for enterprise solutions in 2021 and
            will continue its enterprise customer focus on innovative CPaaS solutions to increase margins.
            By being the leading provider and thus the largest buyer of SMS in its markets. LINK can
            purchase SMS from telecom operators at favorable prices. Additionally, LINK’s position ensures
            priority from the operators, which secures high quality in terms of deliverability.
                                                                                  
            LINK’s subsidiaries operate using their local currencies. Revenue and cost for transactions
            are usually carried out in the same currency. This natural hedge reduces the currency risk and
            protects margins. There is, however, a translation effect to LINK’s reporting currency NOK as
            changes in NOK to underlying currencies will impact reported figures. LINK is also exposed to
            exchange rate risk in relation to its 5-year EUR 370 million outstanding bond. The bond was
            issued at an original size of EUR 200 million on 15 December 2020 and upsized by EUR 170
            million through a tap issue on 16 June 2021. The bond carries a fixed coupon of 3.375% p.a.
            LINK’s significant operational cash flow in EUR lessens this foreign exchange (FX) risk. The
            bond is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and LINK considers its liquidity risk to be limited and
            has sufficient liquidity available on bank accounts as of year-end 2021 to fund operations and
            future M&A agenda. LINK saw marginal losses on trade receivables in 2021 and has established
            efficient routines to monitor and handle overdue trade receivables across its footprint.
                                                                                  
            Management of financial risk is performed with the emphasis on keeping the financial risk
            at a minimum and the main principle is to minimize exposure to financial risk. LINK holds no
            financial assets or liabilities for speculative purposes.             
            Acquisition risk                                                      
                                                                                  
            Value creation through the acquisition of businesses requires the successful purchase of
            suitable companies at sound multiples and well-managed integrations to realize synergies
            and scale advantages. Failure to realize synergies or winner’s curse through overpayment for
            acquired companies may lead to significant value destruction. The results of the prior year’s
            acquisitions confirm that LINK has such expertise. In 2021, the organizational structure and key
            functions were further developed to ensure even more efficient integration of new businesses.

            IT risk includes risks related to LINK’s architecture, data management, information security,
            software development, internal infrastructure and IT Services, business IT and processes, and
            external threats, hereunder cyber incidents. IT risk is managed by central IT functions under the
            authority of LINK’s Chief Technology Officer.                         
                                                                                  
            LINK’s processes are based on a top-down approach, where LINK defines policies and
            procedures for subsidiaries to implement locally. The central IT function provides support and
            counseling to local entities depending on requirements in the covered areas.
            LINK is taking steps to enhance and increase focus on the efforts to minimize the potential
            loss caused by inadequate or failed internal processes, or from external or internal incidents.
            Processes to manage the causes or mitigating the impacts of risks in these areas are therefore
            continuously implemented. In 2021, the following actions should be noticed
                                                                                  
            y Alignment on group level of the process to perform penetration testing on LINK’s platforms
            y Structuring of LINK’s approach to documenting its information security management system

            Legal & compliance risk                                               
                                                                                  
            Legal & compliance risk includes financial or reputational damage that can result from a lack of
            awareness or misunderstanding of, ambiguity in, or indifference to, the way laws, regulations,
            and commitments apply to LINK. Legal & compliance risk at LINK is managed by a group
            function under the authority of the CEO. LINK’s processes are based on a top-down approach,
            where LINK defines policies and procedures for subsidiaries to implement locally. The group
            function provides support and counseling to local entities depending on requirements in the
            covered areas, hereunder areas such as contract alignment and negotiation, GDPR compliance,
            compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, fair competition, and supplier due diligence.
                                                                                  
            LINK’s ESG approach is managed as part of the function, and the specific ESG risks can be seen
            in the material topics under the “Sustainability” section of this report.
                                                                                  
            Internal annual audits are performed for compliance with GDPR. Policies are accessible to
            employees at the LINK Intranet, and training is provided.             
            Operational Risk                                                      
                                                                                  
            Operational risks at LINK include risks related to human rights, health and safety, security, and
            leadership and organization. The area thus covers people, buildings, assets, internal structures,
            and external events.                                                  
                                                                                  
            The safety of all employees is a key priority throughout LINK from headquarters to every local
            subsidiary.                                                           
                                                                                  
            The development of a skilled organization with regards to leadership and key area competence
            is crucial for LINK’s competitiveness, and therefore a top priority.

            Recruitment, training, and people management, as well as dedication to equality and diversity,
            are areas that are continuously developed to ensure growth and robustness in the organization.
                                                                                  
            LINK is taking steps to enhance and increase focus on its efforts to minimize potential losses
            from inadequate or failed internal processes or from external events. Processes to manage the
            causes or mitigate the impacts of risks in these areas are continuously implemented. In 2021,
            the following actions should be noticed.                              
                                                                                  
            y LINK’s introduction of a group-wide CRM system to ensure alignment with group-wide
             processes and policies, and mitigating negative impact through detective controls
                                                                                  
            y LINK’s centralization and structuring of insurance to ensure adequate coverage is aligned in
             all areas                                                            
            Global pandemic                                                       
                                                                                  
            The coronavirus pandemic continued to be a challenge last year and led to numerous
            government restrictions and lockdowns across LINK’s footprint. This was particularly
            challenging for the retail sector and negative effects were observed throughout the year. LINK’s
            growth rates will vary between quarters in 2022 as the lockdowns in 2021 resulted in high and
            low comparables. LINK’s diversified portfolio of customers in various industries across Europe
            and in the U.S. was however an asset and helped to reduce the effect of lower retail volumes.
                                                                                  
            Longer-term, the pandemic is likely to have accelerated the secular digitalization trend with
            numerous new use cases created especially within public services and healthcare. Successful
            mass vaccinations have enabled most European countries to reduce or remove restrictions fully
            as of the end April 2022, which gives hope for more normal activity levels throughout this year.
                                                                                  
            Geopolitical uncertainty                                              
            LINK has no direct business activities in Ukraine and Russia but did terminate a certain
            volume of messages on behalf of customers in these markets. The revenue shortfall, as most
            customers now have ceased operations in Ukraine and Russia, is immaterial compared to total
            group revenues.                                                       
                                                                                  
            The heightened global uncertainty and the unprecedented economic sanction imposed on
            Russia are likely to be negative for world economic growth. This could have an indirect negative
            effect on LINK’s global operations. LINK is however well-diversified with close to fifty thousand
            customers of all sizes in numerous industries and geographies. As the various industries and
            markets are likely to experience different effects from these global shifts, the impact on LINK is
            likely to be mitigated.                                               
                                                                                  
            LINK’s IT security team has assessed its exposure to cyber incidents because of the heightened
            geopolitical uncertainty, taking operations and stakeholders into account. The conclusion as of
            April 2022 is no major risk increase for LINK.                        
            As of the end of April 2022, LINK has observed a modest negative impact from reduced
            business activity in Poland. No direct negative effect from the unprecedented economic

            LINK’s workforce, coupled with its technology, is the most important asset both in terms of
            serving LINK’s customers of today and for the future development of the company. LINK
            continues to strengthen strategic functions within the finance, legal, ESG, project management,
            sales, and technology departments through reorganizing internal competencies and by
            recruiting new employees.                                             
                                                                                  
            Regional segments have also been restructured to maximize synergies. By the end of 2021,
            LINK had 714 employees. 34% of the total LINK workforce is women, compared to 34.6%
            in 2020. The Global Leadership Team (GLT) consists of 8 people, 2 women and 6 men. The
            working environment is regarded as positive . None of LINK’s subsidiaries or the parent

            LINK has a capital structure appropriate to the company’s objective, strategy, and risk profile.
            Dividend Policy is published on LINK’s homepage under corporate governance, key documents.

            4. Equal treatment of shareholders                                    
                                                                                  
            All LINK shareholders are treated equally. If the board of directors was to carry out an increase
            in share capital and waive the pre-emption rights of existing shareholders, the reasoning would
            be fully transparent and publicly disclosed in a stock exchange announcement. Any transactions
            the company carries out in its own shares will be carried out either through the stock exchange
            or at prevailing stock exchange prices. In the case of limited liquidity in the company’s shares,
            LINK will consider other ways to ensure equal treatment of all shareholders.
                                                                                  
            LINK fully complies with the Code.                                    
                                                                                  
            5. Shares and negotiability                                           
                                                                                  
            LINK does not limit any party’s ability to own, trade, or vote for shares in the company. In the
            unlikely event that this was not to be the case, LINK will provide an account of any restrictions
            on owning, trading or voting for shares in the company.               
            LINK fully complies with the Code.

            the fifth business day ahead of the general meeting have a right to attend.
                                                                                  
            The annual general meeting shall resolve the annual accounts and other matters that the
            general meeting is required by law or the articles of association to resolve.
                                                                                  
            All shareholders are invited to the general meeting within the deadlines that follow from law
            and regulations, and all documentation required for the shareholders to sufficiently prepare for
            the general meeting is shared in the invitation and/or by reference to the documents publicly
            available at LINK’s website.                                          
            Deadlines for shareholders to give notice of their intention to attend the meeting are set as
            close to the date of the meeting as possible.                         
                                                                                  
            Members of the board of directors attend the general meeting to the extent it is practically
            possible and in accordance with the goal of minimizing travel. The chairman of the board of
            directors, or a board member who represents the chairman, shall in all cases attend the general
            meeting.                                                              
            The chairman of the nomination committee shall attend the general meeting in person or by
            representative.

            The general meeting elects a chairman for the general meeting and shall be able to elect an
            independent chairman.                                                 
                                                                                  
            Shareholders can vote on each individual matter, including on each individual candidate
            nominated for election.                                               
            Shareholders who cannot attend the meeting in person are given the opportunity to vote
            beforehand or give proxy to do so, through a form provided with the invitation, where each
            individual matter can be voted over separately.                       
                                                                                  
            LINK has not adopted any special procedures regarding the general meeting that deviates from
            provisions applicable for Norwegian public limited liability companies that are listed on the Oslo
            Stock Exchange.                                                       
                                                                                  
            LINK fully complies with the Code except for the board of directors and nomination committee
            attendance. As LINK has a goal of reducing all its travel to the largest extent possible, board
            members shall attend the general meeting only to the extent necessary.
            7. Nomination committee                                               
                                                                                  
            LINK’s Articles of Association provides that LINK shall have a nomination committee comprising
            of two to three members elected for two years by the general meeting of LINK, which shall be
            independent of the board and executive management to ensure that all shareholders’ interests
            are taken into account. The current members of the nomination committee are Tor Malmo
            (Chairman) and Oddny Svergja. The members are not part of LINK’s board or personnel.
                                                                                  
            The general meeting sets guidelines for the duties of the nomination committee, as well as its
            remuneration. A code of conduct for the nomination committee was defined by an extraordinary
            general meeting (EGM) in LINK on September 7th, 2020. The nomination committee’s duties are
            to propose candidates for election to the board and to propose remuneration to be paid to such
            members. The justification for the committee’s proposal is provided separately.
                                                                                  
            The nomination committee is in contact with shareholders, the board of directors and the
            company’s executive personnel as part of its work on proposing candidates for election to the
            board.                                                                
            LINK fully complies with the Code.                                    
                                                                                  
            8. Board of directors’ composition and independence                   
                                                                                  
            The composition of the board of directors shall ensure that the board can attend to the common
            interests of all shareholders and meet the company’s need for expertise, capacity, and diversity.
                                                                                  
            LINK’s Articles of Association stipulate that the company shall have a board consisting of 5 to 9
            members elected by the general meeting. The Articles of Association further determine that the
            chairman of the board shall be elected for two years by the general meeting.
            The composition of the board of directors shall ensure that it can operate independently of any
            special interests. The majority of the shareholder-elected members of the board of directors

            shall thus be independent of the company’s executive personnel and material business
            connections. In addition, at least two of the members of the board must be independent of the
            company’s major shareholders. For the purposes of the LINK Corporate Governance Policy, a
            major shareholder shall mean a shareholder that controls 10% or more of the company’s shares
            or votes. Members of the board are, however, encouraged to own shares in the company.
                                                                                  
            The board of directors does not include executive personnel.          
            There were 6 members on the board through 2021, 3 women and 4 men. With the exception of
            the chairman, who is elected for two years, each board member is elected for one year at the
            annual general meeting.

            current version is dated December 7th, 2021. The board and CEO instructions have a particular
            emphasis on clear internal allocation of responsibilities and duties. 
            The instructions state how the board of directors and executive management handle
            agreements with related parties, including whether an independent valuation must be obtained,
            and that any such agreement will be presented in the annual report.   
                                                                                  
            The board of directors considers any material interests held by board members or executive
            personnel. If the chairman should be personally involved in a matter, another board member
            would chair the consideration of such matter. No such matters have been managed in 2021.
                                                                                  
            The board of directors evaluates its performance and expertise annually.

            In accordance with the Public Companies Act, LINK has established an audit committee
            consisting of board members who are independent of management, and who are appointed for
            a two-year term. The audit committee’s obligations are defined in instructions defined by the
            board. The current version of the audit committee’s instructions is from December 7th, 2021.
            The committee follows up the financial report process, monitors the systems for internal control
            and risk, maintains ongoing contact with LINK’s elected auditor regarding the audit of the annual
            accounts and evaluates and monitors the auditor’s independence, and monitors compliance
            with legal and regulatory requirements.

            LINK has an M&A committee that consists of board members and members of the company’s
            management. The M&A Committee’s obligations are defined in instructions defined by the
            board, and it acts as a preparatory and advisory body to support the board in the process of
            mergers and acquisitions.                                             
                                                                                  
            LINK fully complies with the Code.                                    
                                                                                  
            10. Risk management and internal control                              
                                                                                  
            LINK’s risk management and internal control activities are integrated with its corporate strategy
            and part of the business planning processes in all areas. The Global Leadership Team (GLT) is
            responsible for risk management at LINK, subject to directions and approval from the board of
            directors.                                                            
            Risk management is an integral part of LINK’s business, and it is therefore performed in
            cooperation with operative teams in all parts of the organization. The daily management
            activities that form part of, and follow, the risk management processes are held by the operative
            teams in LINK.                                                        
                                                                                  
            LINK’s audit committee and board are informed of the processes, and the board annually
            approves the risk profile for each of the six risk areas defined by LINK. LINK’s risk profile defines
            the level acceptable in order to reach its goals as defined in by the strategy. The definition forms
            the basis for management execution, controls, and resource allocation within each risk area.
                                                                                  
            LINK is in the process of strengthening its internal control as part of its strategy #LINK25, to
            ensure compliance in the group, hereunder by extending its abilities to provide support through
            tools and resources, and by increasing training and internal audits. LINK’s operative processes
            for risk management are based on an approach where the group organization defines policies
            and procedures enabling entities to implement locally or within a specific area.
            Internal controls are implemented by the functional areas, market, M&A, finance, operational,
            IT and legal & compliance, and each area provides support and information from group level to
            local entities or specific areas depending on requirements. Internal annual audits are performed
            for some areas. Policies are accessible to employees at the LINK Intranet, and training is

            The remuneration of the board of directors reflects the board’s responsibility, expertise, time
            commitment, and the complexity of the company’s activities. The specific remuneration is listed
            in note 8 payroll.                                                    
                                                                                  
            The remuneration of the board of directors is not linked to the company’s performance, and
            share options are not granted to members of the board.                
            LINK fully complies with the Code.                                    
                                                                                  
            12. Salary and other remuneration for executive personnel             
                                                                                  
            The current guidelines for remuneration of executive management were proposed to the
            general meeting in December 2021 and adopted by the board. The guidelines are published and
            available on LINK’s website under LINK-ASA-Guidelines-rem-exec-mngmt.pdf (linkmobility.com).
                                                                                  
            LINK’s performance-related remuneration is defined annually by the board and is subject to an
            absolute limit.                                                       
            LINK fully complies with the Code.                                    
                                                                                  
            13. Information and communication                                     
                                                                                  
            The board of directors has established guidelines for LINK’s reporting of financial and other
            information based on openness and equal treatment of all stakeholders. The board has
            established guidelines for LINK’s contact with shareholders beyond general meetings, including
            a dedicated investor relations professional and management meetings in relation to quarterly
            reporting.                                                            
                                                                                  
            LINK fully complies with the Code.                                    
                                                                                  
            14. Takeovers                                                         
                                                                                  
            The board of directors has established guidelines for the event of a take-over bid. In the case
            of a bid, the board has an independent responsibility to ensure that shareholders are treated
            equally and that business activities are not disrupted unnecessarily. If an offer were to be made
            for LINK’s shares, the board would issue a statement making a recommendation as to whether
            shareholders should or should not accept the offer. The board will ensure shareholders are
            given sufficient information and time to form a view of the offer. The board’s statement on the
            offer will make it clear whether the views expressed are unanimous or specify the basis on
            which specific members excluded themselves. Any final decision to go ahead with a potential
            offer will be made by the shareholders in an extraordinary general meeting (EGM).
            LINK fully complies with the Code.

            15. Auditor                                                           
                                                                                  
            The auditor submits the main features of the plan for the audit of the company to the audit
            committee annually, in time for the committee to review before processing by the board.
                                                                                  
            The auditor is invited to board meetings where the annual accounts are dealt with. At these
            meetings, the auditor reports on any material changes in the company’s accounting principles
            and key aspects of the audit, comment on any material estimated accounting figures, and
            report all material matters on which there has been disagreement between the auditor and the
            executive management of the company.                                  
            The board of directors reviews the company’s internal control procedures with the auditor
            annually, including weaknesses identified by the auditor and proposals for improvement.
                                                                                  
            The board of directors has guidelines in respect of the use of the auditor by the company’s
            executive management for services other than the audit.

            solutions and products. As LINK expands its go-to-market (GTM) initiatives and launches new
            products, demand is expected to support even higher growth. LINK is also executing on its M&A
            strategy with several acquisitions closed in Europe and expansion to the U.S. last year.
            The global pandemic has been a particular challenge for the retail sector and negative effects
            were still observed in the fourth quarter of last year with moderate volumes from retail in
            France.

            This has directly reduced LINK’s medium-term growth rate and the pandemic has also delayed
            the GTM expansion across the footprint. The adoption of CPaaS products has also been more
            incremental in this period than initially assumed.                    
                                                                                  
            LINK has confidence in the medium-term revenue growth range in the forward-looking
            statement of 14-17% based on current market adoption of CPaaS solutions and GTM roll-out.
            Growth rates may however vary between quarters in 2022 as 2021 was impacted by lockdowns,
            resulting in high and low comparables. For full-year 2022, the net retention rate is expected to
            remain above 110% for the Enterprise segment, and gross profits are expected to trend upwards
            in H2 2022 with a normal season for high margin critical events messaging in the US. Potential
            additional growth through M&A will be accretive to LINK’s valuation and deleveraging or at least
            neutral to leverage. A significant deleveraging effect from organic growth is expected to bring
            leverage closer to the financial policy target of <3.5x by end of 2022.
            LINK retains its long-term 2024 forward-looking revenue and margin statement and
            commitment to its 20% annual growth target in a mature CPaaS market with S-curve adoption of
            omnichannel solutions.

            The accounting policies adopted, and methods of computation followed are consistent with
            those of the previous financial year, except for items disclosed below. The adoption of the
            following standards and interpretations has not had any material impact on the disclosures or
            on the amounts reported in these financial statements:

            As at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, Standards and Interpretations had
            been issued by the IASB but were not effective for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.
            At the date of these financial statements, it is not foreseable that these changes will not have a
            material impact on the financial reporting for the Group.             
                                                                                  
            New or amended standards that have effective date on 1 January 2023 or later have not been
            assessed if these will have any impact on Link Mobility Groups financial statements in the
            period of initial application. Management will continue to follow the development of changes to
            Standards and Interpretations issued by the IASB throughout 2022.

                                     LINK Mobility Group Holding ASA Annual report 2021 87
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            3.2 Basis for preparation                                             
            The financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with
            International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting
            Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the European Union. The financial statements have
            been prepared on the historical cost basis.                           
                                                                                  
            The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain
            critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgments in applying
            the Group’s accounting policies. Areas involving a high degree of judgment or complexity,
            and areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are
            disclosed in Note 4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation variances.
            The financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis. 
                                                                                  
            The presentation currency of the financial statement is Norwegian kroner (NOK). Amounts are
            rounded to nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.                 
                                                                                  
            3.3 Principles of consolidation                                       
            The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company
            and its subsidiaries, which are entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when
            the Group has power over the investee, is exposed, or has rights to, variable returns from its
            involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns through
            its power over the investee. The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and
            circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control
            noted above.                                                          
                                                                                  
            The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting periods as
            the parent company and consistent accounting policies are applied. The results of subsidiaries
            acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement from the date
            when control is obtained and until control ceases, respectively. Intercompany transactions,
            balances, revenues, expenses and unrealised Group internal gains or losses are eliminated on
            consolidation.                                                        
            The presentation currency of the financial statement is Norwegian kroner (NOK). Amounts are
            rounded to nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.                 
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            3.4 Business combinations                                             
            Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration
            transferred and all the identifiable assets and liabilities of acquired entities are, with limited
            exceptions measured at fair values at the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs are
            recognised in the income statement as incurred.                       
                                                                                  
            Goodwill arising from an acquisition is recognised as an asset measured as the excess of the
            sum of the consideration transferred, the fair value of any previous held equity interest and the
            amount of any non-controlling interest in the investee over the net amounts of the identifiable
            assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the
            net fair value of the investee’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the

            total consideration of the business combination, the excess is immediately recognised in the
            income statement. Goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups
            of cash generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
            A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows
            that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. If the
            recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment
            loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment
            loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for
            goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.                       
                                                                                  
            When the consideration transferred by the Company in a business combination includes
            contingent consideration arrangements, the contingent consideration is measured at its
            acquisition date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business
            combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement
            period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments recognised in
            goodwill. Measurement period adjustments arise from additional information obtained during
            the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about
            facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. The subsequent accounting for
            changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement
            period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent
            consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and
            its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Other contingent consideration is
            remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates with changes in fair value recognised in
            profit or loss.                                                       
            If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting
            period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items
            for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the
            measurement period (see above), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new
            information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that,
            if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date. 
                                                                                  
            3.5 Current/non-current classification                                
                                                                                  
            An asset is classified as current when it is expected to be realised, or is intended for sale or
            consumption, in the Group’s normal operating cycle, it is expected/due to be realised or settled
            within next twelve month after the reporting date. Other assets are classified as non-current. A
            liability is classified as current when it is expected to be settled in the Group’s normal operating
            cycle, the liability is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period or if the
            Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve

            Revenues are recognised when services are rendered and measured based on the consideration
            to which the Group expects to be entitled in a contract with a customer net of discounts and
            sales related taxes. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control of a product or
            service to a customer.

            When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, the Group
            evaluates whether it has an obligation to provide the specified service itself (i.e. the Group is the
            principle) or to arrange for those services to be provided by the other party (i.e. the Group is the
            agent). Where the Group does not control the service, the Group is considered an agent in the
            transaction.                                                          
                                                                                  
            Revenues primarily comprise sale of services that enable customers to communicate by mobile
            phone with their customers. To be able to render these services, the Group needs to obtain
            services from one or more telecommunication operators. Cost incurred that are directly related
            to fulfilling a specified contract with a customer are regarded as a contract fulfilment cost and
            are expensed in the period in which the related revenue is recognised.
            The services rendered are split into the following groups:

            3.7 Foreign currency translation                                      
            The consolidated financial statements are presented in NOK, which is the Group’s functional
            currency. In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in
            currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recognised at the rate of exchange
            on the date of the transaction. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are
            denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary
            items carried at fair value in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate at the
            date when the fair value was measured. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of
            historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated after the transaction date.
                                                                                  
            Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents
            are presented in the income statement as financial items. All other foreign exchange gains
            and losses are presented on a net basis in the income statement as other operating expenses.
            Exchange differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
                                                                                  
            For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of
            the Group’s foreign operations are translated to NOK at exchange rates on the reporting date.
            Income and expense items are translated to NOK at the average exchange rates for the period,
            unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange
            rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in
            other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity.
            Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are
            considered as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. These
            exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.    
                                                                                  
            On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign
            operation), or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign
            operation, all of the exchange differences accumulated in a separate component of equity in
            respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the foreign operation are reclassified to
            the income statement. In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes
            a foreign operation that does not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiary, the
            proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences is re-attributed to non-controlling
            interests and are not recognised in profit or loss.                   
                                                                                  
            3.8 Intangible assets                                                 
            Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised initially as
            set out in 3.4 Business Combinations above.

            Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently
            when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated,
            may be impaired. Goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups
            of cash-generating units) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the
            recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the
            impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the
            unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each
            asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent
            period. On disposal of a cash generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in
            the determination of the gain or loss on disposal in the income statement.
                                                                                  
            Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill,
            such as Tradename and Customer relations are recognised initially at their fair value at the
            acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).                   
            Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination
            are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
            Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The
            estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting
            period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
            Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated impairment
            losses.                                                               
                                                                                  
            Separately acquired intangible assets                                 
                                                                                  
            Intangible assets with finite useful lives such as Technology, that are acquired separately
            are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
            Subsequent to initial recognition, separately acquired intangible assets are reported at cost
            less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as
            intangible assets that are acquired in a business combination.        
            Internally generated intangible assets – Technology                   
                                                                                  
            Expenditure on research and development activities is recognised as an expense in the period
            in which it is incurred. An internally generated intangible asset arising from development of
            the Group’s technical platforms and products is recognised if, and only if, all the following
            conditions have been demonstrated:                                    
            y the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use
             or sale;                                                             
                                                                                  
            y the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;  
            y the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;                    
            y how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
            y the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the
             development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and             
            y the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its
             development.

            The amount initially recognised for internally generated intangible assets is the sum of the
            expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria
            listed above. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development
            expenditures are expensed as incurred.                                
                                                                                  
            Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost
            less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as
            intangible assets that are acquired in a business combination.        
                                                                                  
            3.9 Equipment and fixtures                                            
            Equipment and fixtures are initially recognised at cost, which includes the purchase price
            (including duties and non-refundable purchase taxes) and any directly attributable costs of
            bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be able to operate in the
            intended manner. Equipment and fixtures are subsequently recognised at cost less accumulated
            depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is recognised using the
            straight-line method to reduce the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful
            lives. Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
                                                                                  
            Estimated useful life, depreciation method and residual values are reviewed at least annually.
            The straight-line depreciation method is used as this best reflects the consumption of the
            assets, which often is the passage of time. Residual value is estimated to be zero for all assets.
            Repair and maintenance are expensed as incurred. If new parts are capitalised, replaced parts
            are derecognised and any remaining net carrying amount is recognised in operating profit (loss)
            as loss on disposal.                                                  
                                                                                  
            An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future
            economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss
            arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of equipment and fixtures is determined as the
            difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is presented
            as other income or other expenses in the income statement.            
                                                                                  
            3.10 Impairment of non-financial assets                               
            At each reporting date, the Group reviews if there are any indicators that the carrying amounts
            of its tangible and intangible assets may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the
            recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss
            (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets,
            the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset
            belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate
            assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to
            the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation
            basis can be identified.                                              
                                                                                  
            Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least
            annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

            Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In
            assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
            using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
            money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not
            been adjusted.                                                        
            If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its
            carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its
            recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
                                                                                  
            Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-
            generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that
            the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
            determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in
            prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless
            the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment
            loss is treated as a revaluation increase. Any impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not
            reversed in a subsequent period.                                      
                                                                                  
            3.11 Leases                                                           
            At the inception of a contract, the company assesses whether the contract is, or contains,
            a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the
            use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The lease
            liability is recognized at the commencement date and measured at the present value of the
            remaining lease payments, discounted using the company’s incremental borrowing rate at
            the commencement date. The lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that
            a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with similar security, the funds
            necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value of the right-of-use asset in a similar economic
            environment.                                                          
                                                                                  
            The Group has chosen to measure the Right-of-Use asset (RoU assets) at an amount equal
            to the lease liability for all leases by using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate; the rate
            may differ from country to country. RoU assets are depreciated over the lease term as this
            is ordinarily shorter than the useful life of the assets. The lease term represents the non-
            cancellable period of the lease, together with periods covered by an option either to extend or to
            terminate the lease when the company is reasonably certain to exercise this option. The Group
            applies the exemption for short term leases (12 months or less) and low value leases. As such,
            related lease payments are not recognized in the balance sheet but expensed or capitalized in
            line with the accounting treatment for other non-lease expenses. The inclusion of non-lease
            components may vary across different lease categories.                
                                                                                  
            3.12 Government grants                                                
            The Group receives Government grant as part of the “Skattefunn” arrangement in Norway, which
            is an arrangement to stimulate research and development in Norway. The government grant is
            initially recognised as a deduction to the carrying amount of the relevant asset. The amount is
            subsequently recognised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated
            useful life of the related asset.

            3.13 Financial Instruments                                            
            Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs
            that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities
            (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added
            to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate,
            on initial recognition. The Group has classified the financial instruments into the following
            categories of financial assets and liabilities: Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through
            profit and loss (FVTPL), financial assets at amortised cost (FAAC), financial assets at fair value
            through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and Financial liability at cost (FLAC). Currently
            the Group does not have any assets in the classification of FVTOCI.   
                                                                                  
            The categorisation of financial instruments (financial assets and liabilities) for measurement
            purposes is based on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument and is determined on
            initial recognition. The Group presents financial assets and liabilities in the following classes:
            trade and other receivables (FAAC), cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables (FLAC),
            and borrowings (FLAC).                                                
            Trade receivables and other current and non-current financial assets  
                                                                                  
            The financial assets held by the Group, primarily trade and other receivables, are held within
            a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual
            cash flows and are thus measured subsequently at amortised cost less loss allowances. The
            impairment model in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments requires the recognition of impairment
            provisions based on expected credit losses (ECL). The Group recognises an allowance for
            expected credit losses on trade receivables. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at
            each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. The impairment is
            calculated by taking into account the historic evidence of the level of credit losses experienced
            and the ageing profile of the trade receivables. Individual trade receivables are impaired when
            management assesses them not to be wholly or partially collectible.   
                                                                                  
            Cash and cash equivalents                                             
            Cash and cash equivalents include cash, bank deposits and commercial papers with original
            maturities of three months or less.                                   
                                                                                  
            Financial liabilities                                                 
                                                                                  
            Trade and other payables include trade payables and other current and non-current, non-
            interest-bearing financial liabilities. Borrowings (non-current and current) include bank loans and
            overdrafts. These liabilities are initially recognised in the statement of financial position at fair
            value (net of any transaction costs), and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
            effective interest rate method.                                       
            The effective interest method calculates the amortised cost of a financial liability and the
            allocation of interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate
            that discounts estimated future cash payments, including all fees and points paid or received
            that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums

            The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are
            discharged, cancelled, or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the
            financial liability derecognised, and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or
            loss.

            The Group presents the statement of cash flows using the indirect method. Cash inflows and
            outflows are shown separately for investing and financing activities, while operating activities
            include both cash and non-cash line items. Interest received and paid, and dividends received,
            are reported as a part of operating activities. Dividends distributed are included as a part of
            financing activities. Value Added Tax and other similar taxes are regarded as collection of tax on
            behalf of authorities.                                                
                                                                                  
            3.15 Employee benefits                                                
                                                                                  
            The Group operates a defined contribution plan (DCP) for post-retirement benefits. A defined
            contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate
            entity (insurance company). The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further
            contributions to the pension plan for benefits relating to employee service in the current and
            prior periods. Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an
            expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. Prepaid
            contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the
            future payments is available.                                         
                                                                                  
            3.16 Taxation                                                         
            Income tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred income tax. The income tax
            expense is recognised in the income statement unless the tax effect relates to items recognised
            in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax effect is recognised in
            other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.                
                                                                                  
            Current tax is the expected tax expense on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates and
            laws which have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
            Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised, using the balance sheet method, for
            temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial
            reporting purposes and the amount used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are
            recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits. Deferred tax is
            not recognised for temporary differences arising on initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a
            transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable
            profits, nor for differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable
            that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for
            taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
                                                                                  
            Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary
            differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively
            enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. A deferred
            tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the future taxable profits will be

            available against which the temporary differences, tax losses carried forward and unused tax
            credits can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced
            to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow
            all or part of the asset to be realised.                              
                                                                                  
            Tax positions are regularly reviewed to identify situations where it is not probable that the
            relevant tax authorities will accept the treatment used in the tax filings. Uncertain tax positions
            are considered independently or as a group, depending on which approach better predicts
            re resolution of uncertainty. If the Group concludes that it is not probable that the taxation
            authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of uncertainty is reflected when
            determining tax treatment. This is done by using either the most likely amount or the expected
            value, depending on which method better predicts the outcome of the uncertainty. Uncertain tax
            treatment can affect both current tax and deferred tax.               
            Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when the legal right to offset exists and
            the Group intends to either settle the tax assets and the tax liability net or recover the asset and
            settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are generally
            offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and current tax liabilities.
                                                                                  
            Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit
            before tax because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in
            other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s
            current tax liability is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted
            by the end of the reporting period.                                   
                                                                                  
            A provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax determination is uncertain, but it is
            considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority. The provisions
            are measured at the best estimate of the amount expected to become payable.
            Deferred tax is recognized based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts
            of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax
            bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the liability method.
            Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and
            deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences are recognized to the extent
            that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
            differences can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
            reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable
            profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
                                                                                  
            Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in
            the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates that have been
            enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.  
                                                                                  
            Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off
            current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by
            the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities
            on a net basis.

            and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity
            respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business
            combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            Note 4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of              
            estimation variances                                                  
                                                                                  
            In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, as described in note 3 (summary of
            significant accounting policies), management is required to make judgements, estimates and
            assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
            Estimates and judgements are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical
            experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are considered to be
            relevant. Future events may cause these estimates to change and actual results may differ from
            these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
                                                                                  
            Changes in accounting estimates are recognised in the period when the changes occurred,
            if they apply to that period. If the changes also apply to future periods, the effect will be
            distributed between the current period and future periods.            
                                                                                  
            Business combinations                                                 
            The Group has finalised certain acquisitions in FY2021; refer to note 5 (business combinations)
            for further details. In order to account for the business combinations and determine the fair
            value of the underlying assets and liabilities in accordance with IFRS 3, management has used
            significant judgement. In order to calculate the fair value of the intangible assets in the acquired
            companies, the expected future cash flows have been reconciled to the purchase price of the
            acquired companies. The reconciliation is performed via a Business Enterprise Valuation (BEV).
            Intangible assets have been valued using the Multi Excess Earnings Method (“MEEM”) and
            Relief From Royalty Method (“RFR”). The methods are considered to be appropriate for the type
            of assets being valued (MEEM for customer relationships and RFR for technology and trade
            name). The excess of the consideration over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired
            is recognised as goodwill.                                            
                                                                                  
            Significant input used in the estimation of fair values utilising the above methods are as follows:
                                                                                  
            y The remaining estimated useful life of customer relationships is between 7 and 10 years
            y The remaining estimated useful life of technology is 10 years       
            y Revenue growth and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation)
             margins are based on estimates of growth and margins in the respective companies

            Estimated impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets          
            The carrying amounts of non-current tangible and intangible assets are assessed by means of
            impairment tests whenever there is an indication of impairment. Any impairment of goodwill
            is assessed at least annually. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been
            determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require management to
            estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable
            discount rate in order to calculate present value. As of 31 December 2021, the amount of
            goodwill tested for impairment amounted to KNOK 5 614 510 (FY2020 - KNOK 3 982 843). No
            impairment losses were recognised in FY2021 (FY2020 - nil). Please refer to notes 3 (summary
            of significant accounting policies) and 13 (intangible assets) for further details related to the
            impairment testing methodology and results.                           
                                                                                  
            Deferred tax assets                                                   
                                                                                  
            Management judgment is required in determining provisions for income taxes, deferred tax
            assets and liabilities and the extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized. The Group
            is also subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the
            Group’s provision for income taxes. There may be transactions and calculations for which the
            ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final
            tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such
            differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax liability and expense in the period in
            which such determination is made.                                     
                                                                                  
            Purchase price of subsidiaries – earn-out                             
            Periodically, the Group acquires subsidiaries where the preliminary purchase price is based on
            an assumption that the acquired company will achieve a target EBITDA for the current financial
            year. The final purchase price is subject to an upwards or downwards earn-out adjustment
            based on the company’s actual achieved EBITDA. The earn-out adjustment is accounted for in
            the income statement as finance income or expense.

            The Group reports revenue, gross margin (revenue less direct costs) and adjusted EBITDA in
            functional operating segments to the Board of Directors (the Group’s chief operating decision
            makers). While LINK uses all four measures to analyze performance, the Group’s strategy of
            profitable growth means that adjusted EBITDA is the prevailing measure of performance (refer
            to alternate performance measures).

            Europe, Central Europe, Northern America and Global Messaging; these represent market
            clusters. Generally, regions are segregated into similar geographic locations as these follow
            similar market trends. Global Messaging includes all regions with aggregator traffic; the other
            four have enterprise traffic.

            Global Messaging                                                      
            Global messaging is comprised of non-enterprise traffic and is representative of either stand-
            alone business or as a component of revenues in countries included above. If a business is
            comprised of both enterprise and wholesale/aggregator transactions, the latter is segregated
            here. The Swiss operation Horisen Messaging is included here.         
                                                                                  
            Wholesale/aggregator business is defined as an operating unit within LINK’s industry, and
            that use LINK connections in markets where they do not have such connections themselves.
            This business can generally be referred to, at least partly, as a direct competitor that use LINK
            connections. Smaller local aggregators cannot be expected to be covered efficiently by Global
            Messaging and as such they are still subject to local handling (not a focus area though because
            they are generally low margin and switch easily).

            The Group’s leasing activities and how these are accounted for:       
            The Group leases office space, equipment and vehicles. Rental contracts are typically made for
            fixed periods between 1 and 10 years but may have extension options as described below.
                                                                                  
            Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the
            consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative
            stand-alone prices. However, for leases of real estate (buildings) for which the group is a lessee,
            it has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components and instead accounts for these
            as a single lease component.                                          
            Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms
            and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security
            interests in the leased assets that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as
            security for borrowing purposes.                                      
                                                                                  
            Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which
            the leased asset is available for use by the Group.                   
                                                                                  
            Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease
            liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:
            y Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;
                                                                                  
            y Variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index
             or rate as at the commencement date;                                 
                                                                                  
            y Amounts expected to be payable by the group under residual value guarantees;

            y The exercise price of a purchase option if the group is reasonably certain to exercise that
             option; and                                                          
                                                                                  
            y Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the group
             exercising that option.                                              
                                                                                  
            Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the
            measurement of the liability.                                         
            The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate
            cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s
            incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay
            to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a
            similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.
                                                                                  
            To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:               
                                                                                  
            y Where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a
             starting point, adjusted to reflect changes in financing conditions since third party financing
             was received;                                                        
                                                                                  
            y Uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for
             leases held by Group subsidiaries, which do not have recent third-party financing; and
            y Makes adjustments specific to the lease (i.e. term, country, currency and security).
                                                                                  
            The Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on
            an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When
            adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is
            reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.               
                                                                                  
            Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged
            to profit or loss over the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the
            remaining balance of the liability for each period.                   
                                                                                  
            Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:    
                                                                                  
            y The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;           
            y Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives
             received;                                                            
                                                                                  
            y Any initial direct costs; and                                       
            y Restoration costs.                                                  
                                                                                  
            Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the

            The pension plans in the Group comply with the pension legislation enacted in respective
            countries. The pension plans require that the Group pays premiums to public or private
            administrative pension plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. There are no
            further obligations once the annual premiums are paid. The premiums are accounted for as
            personnel expenses as soon as they are incurred. Pre-paid premiums are accounted for as an
            asset to the extent that future benefits can be determined as plausible.

            the RSU’s and LTI’s are calculated at the time of allocation and expensed over the vesting period.
                                                                                  
            In Q4 2020, the Company issued 3 769 092 RSU’s and 2 000 000 LTI’s to selected employees,
            including management. Fair value of RSU’s and LTI’s were calculated to NOK 46.995 (for all
            practical purposes equal to the share price) and NOK 20.3 at the grant date, respectively.

            As at 31.12.2021 there was a total of NOK 7.8 million accrued in social security expenses,
            based on a weighted average of the social security tax rates in the recipients countries.
                                                                                  
            Fair value of the LTI’s and RSU’s are calculated using an adjusted (for exercise behavior) Black-
            Scholes option pricing model.                                         
            The following assumptions are used in the calculations:               
                                                                                  
            y The share price is set equal to the offer price on October 20th 2020 (date of completetion of
             the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Link Mobility Group Holding ASA.
                                                                                  
            y The strike price for the RSUs is set equal to the nominal share value (NOK 0.005).
            y We assume that historical volatility of a selected group comparable companies within the
             CPaaS-univserse is an indication of future volatility.               
                                                                                  
            y Expected volatility is set identical to historical volatility, equal to 61 % in the calculations for
             the first LTI’s and for the RSU’s. The volatility for the LTI II is estimated at 51%.
            y We assume that the employees will exercise the options at the mid-point between earliest

             Government Bonds corresponding to the lifetime of the option.

            The LINK name was established in 2008 and has become a known name within the mobile
            solutions industry. The estimated useful life is determined to be 25 years and is amortised
            accordingly. The trade name has not been allocated to specific CGUs.  
                                                                                  
            Customer Relationships                                                
            For customer relationships identified and recognised through business combinations, the
            amortisation period is estimated to be between 7-10 years. The amortisation period is based
            on an analysis of customer churn and the remaining useful life of the customer relationships
            recogonised in the balance sheet.

            Amortisation of capital expenditure for the development of Group technology is between 3-10
            years. For technology acquired through business combinations, the amortisation period is
            between 7-10 years based on an evalution of the technological solution.

            Goodwill generated from business combinations is primarily related to anticipated growth
            prospects for the acquired businesses. No impairment has been recognised subsequent to the
            business combination.

            Impairment test                                                       
            Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life (i.e. trade name) are not
            amortised. They are tested for impairment on an annual basis at a cash generating unit
            (hereafter “CGU”) level, and more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be
            impaired. In accordance with IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets, the carrying amount of the CGU
            to which goodwill has been allocated is compared with the recoverable amount of the CGU.
            The recoverable amount is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations
            use cash flow projections reflective of management’s best estimate extended over a five year
            period. The assumed growth rate has been based on the management growth estimate for the
            next five years and subsequently reduced to 2% for the purpose of determining the terminal
            value. The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flows are calculated based on the weighted
            average cost of capital (WACC) specific to each CGU and are within the range of 6.5% - 12.5%.
                                                                                  
            Based on the calculations referred to above, it has been concluded that the recoverable amount
            exceeds the carrying amount of each CGU. No impairment has been recognized for FY2021
            (FY2020 - nil).

            Sensitivity analysis                                                  
            In connection with the impairment testing of intangible assets, a sensitivity analysis has been
            performed. The sensitivity analysis has tested changes in terminal growth; if no terminal
            growth (zero-rated) is used, there is still impairment headroom for all CGU’s with the exception
            of the Baltics and Spain. The estimates used to determine future cash flows and WACC when
            calculating value in use are subject to uncertainty. The assumptions are described as follows:
                                                                                  
            Budgeted period - The basis for the projection of the future cash flows estimated is based
            on the financial budget of one year. The budget in combination with the forecasts represent
            management’s best estimate of the rance of economic conditions that will exist over a five-year
            period. The forecasted years are estimated based on the company’s strategic initiatives.
                                                                                  
            Local currency and Fx rates - All CGU’s forecasted projections are done using NOK.
            Terminal value - Terminal value is calculated using the Gordon growth formula based on
            previous year cash-flow, user-specified long-term growth and WACC for the specific CGU.
                                                                                  
            WACC - future cash flows are discounted to present value using a discounted rate based on a
            calculation of a weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The pre-tax WACC is based on an
            average interest rate adjusted for each CGU.                          
                                                                                  
            Management have concluded that no forseable change in any of the key assumptions used
            in the impairment test would cause the carrying amounts of the cash-generating units with
            significant goodwill to exceed recoverable amounts.

            The above trade receivables and other receivables represent the Group’s maximum exposure to
            credit risk at the balance sheet date.                                
            Trade accounts receivable relate to the sale of mobile messaging transactions, payment
            services, licenses, and consulting services; these are withing the normal operating cycle.
                                                                                  
            Accrued revenues are representative of an estimate for messaging traffic. An accrual
            for revenue is made to best reflect volumes in advance of when an invoice from the
            telecommunications provider is received.                              
                                                                                  
            The Group measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime
            expected credit losses. Based on historical trends, the Group recognises a loss allowance of
            100% against all receivables over 120 days past due, unless it is probable that the receivable
            will be collected based on past experience with customer and financial position of the debtor.
            Additional allowances for specific balances are recognised based on past experience and an
            analysis of the financial position of the debtor along with other relevant factors.
            There is no loss allowance related to accrued revenues.               
                                                                                  
            The Group has recognised a provision for bad debts of KNOK 37 621 (FY2020 - KNOK 29 617).
            Trade receivables recognised as a part of business combinations are recognised at fair value on
            the date of acquisition, allowance for impairment amounted to KNOK 0 (FY2020 - KNOK 302).

            The cash pool is a zero-balancing cash-pool, including the automatic transfers of funds between
            a master account and subsidiary accounts to cover deposit and withdrawal activity wihin the
            arrangement.                                                          
            LINK Mobility Group AS is the cash pool administrator/master and holder of the top accounts
            in different currencies (defined as Facility Accounts). In addition to Facility Accounts, various
            transactional accounts exist in the same currency as the Facility Account; these are defined as
            Detail Accounts.                                                      
                                                                                  
            Funds deposited into a Detail Account are automatically and instantly transferred to a Facility
            Account. Similarly, funds withdrawn from a Detail Account are automatically and instantly
            transferred from a Facility Account. The Detail Accounts maintain a balance of zero, whereas
            each Facility Account holds the credit or debit balance of the funds available for drawing in the
            cash pool.                                                            
                                                                                  
            A Facility Account (and its balance) is owned solely by LINK and creates rights and obligations
            only between LINK and the bank. The balance on the Facility Accounts is subject to interest
            calculations between LINK and the bank. Transactions (deposits or withdrawals) cannot be
            performed on a Facility Account, but must be performed using a Detail Account.
            The Bank registers each transaction between each Facility Account and each Detail Account
            in the cash pool and the total balance thereof. This balance reflects the intra-Group balance
            between LINK and each Detail Account Holder. The participating entities of the Group have
            internal balances toward LINK through the use of the Detail Accounts.

            The financial assets held by the Group are held within a business model whose objective
            is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and are thus measured
            subsequently at amortised cost less loss allowances.                  
            All financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost.             
                                                                                  
            The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value as at 31

            ¹ The bond loan is initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs and it is subsequently
            measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Consequently, the
            transaction cost will be amortized over the life of the bond loan. The carrying value of the bond
            loan will be equal to the principal amount of EUR 370 million at maturity in FY2025.

            Interest rate risk arises as a consequence of long-term debt. In December 2020 the Company
            successfully completed the issuance of EUR 200 million senior unsecured bonds, with a EUR
            350 million borrowing limit.                                          
                                                                                  
            On 23 June 2021, LINK issued EUR 170 million new bonds in LINK’s outstanding 5-year senior
            unsecured 3.375% fixed rate bond issue, raising the total outstanding amount to EUR 370
            million. The bonds were issued at par; refer to note 19 for further details.

            The sensitivity analysis below is based on the exposure to changes in interest rates for non-
            derivative instruments at the reporting date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared
            assuming the amount outstanding at reporting date was outstanding for the whole year. A one
            percent increase or decrease represents management’s assessment of reasonable and possible
            changes in interest rates.                                            
                                                                                  
            If interest rates had been one percent higher/lower and all other variables were held constant,
            the Group’s profit (and corresponding equity) for the period ended 31 December 2021 would
            decrease/increase by KNOK 36 959 (FY2020 KNOK 20 941). This is mainly attributable to the
            Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.   
                                                                                  
            Foreign exchange risk                                                 
            The Group undertakes business in foreign currencies and is consequently exposed to
            fluctuations in exchange rates. Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions related to
            operations conducted, and assets and liabilities arising in foreign currencies. The Group
            undertakes transactions denominated in NOK, DKK, EUR, SEK, PLN, BGN, CHF, GBP, HUF, RON,
            MKD and USD. Revenue and cost transactions within foreign subsidiaries are normally carried
            out in the same currency, which mitigates the currency risk.          
                                                                                  
            However, as the Group’s overall financial reporting is presented in NOK, changes in the value of
            DKK, EUR, SEK, PLN, BGN, CHF, GBP, HUF, RON, MKD or USD in relation to NOK affect the Group’s
            overall revenue, profit or loss and financial position. Based on exposure throughout the year
            and balances at the period-end, the Group assesses that fluctuations in NOK/EUR, NOK/SEK
            and NOK/CHF have the most significant impact on the financial reporting of financial assets
            and liabilities. The table below summarises the impact a change in these currencies will have
            on the consolidated income statement and on retained earnings/accumulated losses as at
            31 December 2021. The analysis is based on the assumption that the foreign exchange rates
            increase or decrease by 10%, all other variables held constant.

            Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty defaulting. The Group’s credit risk is limited to trade and
            other receivables and is mitigated by the Group’s guidelines to ensure that credit sales are only
            made to customers with high credit rating. Customers with a low credit rating are required to
            prepay for services rendered by the Group.                            
            The Group’s credit risk related to trade receivables is assessed to be limited due to the high
            number of diverse customers in the Group’s customer base. Refer to note 15 for additional
            information related to trade and other receivables.

            As at 31 December 2021 and as at the date of signing of this annual report, certain Group
            subsidiaries are involved in ongoing legal proceedings as either defendant or as plaintiff. Due to
            the uncertain outcome for all of these ongoing proceedings, there are no provisions (contingent
            or otherwise) accounted for in the financial statements or disclosed elsewhere in the notes to
            the financial statements. Claims for which Group entities are defendants are deemed to be low
            risk as the majority are covered by guarantees as a result of acquisitions (M&A).
            A list of ongoing legal proceedings is provided as follows:

            The financial information in this report is prepared under International Financial Reporting
            Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU. To enhance the understanding of LINK’s performance,
            the Group presents several alternative performance measures (“APM’s”). An APM is defined
            by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) guidelines as a financial measure of
            historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial
            measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework (IFRS).
                                                                                  
            Below, LINK presents certain APMs, including gross profit, gross margin, EBITDA, adjusted
            EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin.

            companies in the markets in which LINK competes and are widely used by investors when
            comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to factors such as depreciation
            and amortization, which can vary significantly, depending upon accounting methods
            (particularly when acquisitions have occurred) or based on non-operating factors.

            Gross margin means gross profit as a percentage of total operating revenues.

            Adjusted EBITDA means EBITDA adjusted by expenses related to significant one-time, non-
            recurring events such as acquisitions and restructuring activities, legal advisors, and share-
            based compensation. LINK has presented adjusted EBITDA in the consolidated statement
            of profit and loss because management believes the measure provides useful information
            regarding operating performance.

            EBITDA means earnings before interest, taxes, amortization, depreciation, and impairments.
            LINK has presented EBITDA in the consolidated statement of profit and loss because
            management believes that the measure provides useful information regarding the Group’s ability
            to service debt and to fund capital expenditures and provides a helpful measure for comparing
            its operating performance with that of other companies.

            The Group monitors Net debt according to Bond loan terms which includes interest-bearing debt
            and debt like arrangements. Net debt is derived from the balance sheet and consists of both
            current and non-current liabilities such as bond loan, other debt from financial institutions and
            current and non-current lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents. Sellers credits, holdback
            and earn-outs are excluded as they are not interest-bearing.

            LINK measures leverage ratio as Net debt/Last Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA. The measure
            provides useful information about the financial position. Due to the significant M&A activity
            LINK use Last Twelve Months Proforma Adjusted EBITDA to calculate net debt to present a

            A number of amended IFRS standards issued by the International Accounting Standards
            Board (IASB) and IFRS interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS
            IC) are effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 01 January 2021. The
            requirements arising from revised IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations are embedded in the
            recognition, measurement and disclosures relevant to the consolidated financial statements
            of the Group from the date of establishment. The accounting policies adopted are described
            in Note 3 Summary of significant accounting policies.                 
                                                                                  
            Standards and interpretations affecting amounts reported in the current period
            The accounting policies adopted, and methods of computation followed are consistent with
            those of the previous financial year, except for items disclosed below. The adoption of the
            following standards and interpretations has not had any material impact on the disclosures or
            on the amounts reported in these financial statements:

            As at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, Standards and Interpretations
            had been issued by the IASB but were not effective for the financial year ended 31 December
            2021. At the date of these financial statements, it is not foreseable that these changes will not
            have a material impact on the financial reporting for the Group.      
                                                                                  
            New or amended standards that have effective date on 1 January 2023 or later have not been
            assessed if these will have any impact on Link Mobility Groups financial statements in the
            period of initial application. Management will continue to follow the development of changes
            to Standards and Interpretations issued by the IASB throughout 2022.

            individual amounts. This is due to the rounding of whole figures to thousands for presentation
            purposes.                                                             
                                                                                  
            3.2 Basis for preparation                                             
            The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International
            Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
            (IASB) and adopted by the European Union. The financial statements have been prepared on the
            historical cost basis.                                                
                                                                                  
            The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain
            critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgments in applying
            the Group’s accounting policies. Areas involving a high degree of judgment or complexity,
            and areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are
            disclosed in Note 4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation variances.
            The financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis. 
                                                                                  
            The presentation currency of the financial statement is Norwegian kroner (NOK). Amounts are
            rounded to nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.                 
                                                                                  
            3.3 Principles of consolidation                                       
            The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company
            and its subsidiaries, which are entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when
            the Group has power over the investee, is exposed, or has rights to, variable returns from its
            involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns through
            its power over the investee. The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and
            circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control
            noted above.                                                          
                                                                                  
            The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting periods as
            the parent company and consistent accounting policies are applied. The results of subsidiaries
            acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement from the date
            when control is obtained and until control ceases, respectively. Intercompany transactions,
            balances, revenues, expenses and unrealised Group internal gains or losses are eliminated on
            consolidation.                                                        
            The presentation currency of the financial statement is Norwegian kroner (NOK). Amounts are
            rounded to nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.                 
                                                                                  
            3.4 Business combinations                                             
                                                                                  
            Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration
            transferred and all the identifiable assets and liabilities of acquired entities are, with limited
            exceptions measured at fair values at the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs are
            recognised in the income statement as incurred.                       
            Goodwill arising from an acquisition is recognised as an asset measured as the excess of the
            sum of the consideration transferred, the fair value of any previous held equity interest and the

            assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the
            net fair value of the investee’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the
            total consideration of the business combination, the excess is immediately recognised in the
            income statement. Goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups
            of cash generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
            A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows
            that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. If the
            recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment
            loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment
            loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for
            goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.                       
                                                                                  
            When the consideration transferred by the Company in a business combination includes
            contingent consideration arrangements, the contingent consideration is measured at its
            acquisition date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business
            combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement
            period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments recognised in
            goodwill. Measurement period adjustments arise from additional information obtained during
            the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about
            facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. The subsequent accounting for
            changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement
            period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent
            consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and
            its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Other contingent consideration is
            remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates with changes in fair value recognised in
            profit or loss.                                                       
            If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting
            period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items
            for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the
            measurement period (see above), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new
            information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that,
            if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.

            An asset is classified as current when it is expected to be realised, or is intended for sale or
            consumption, in the Company’s normal operating cycle, it is expected/due to be realised or
            settled within next twelve month after the reporting date. Other assets are classified as non-
            current. A liability is classified as current when it is expected to be settled in the Company’s
            normal operating cycle, the liability is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting
            period or if the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability
            for at least twelve months after the reporting period. All other liabilities are classified as non-
            current.

            3.6 Revenue recognition                                               
            Revenues are recognised when services are rendered and measured based on the consideration
            to which the Company expects to be entitled in a contract with a customer net of discounts and
            sales related taxes. The Company recognises revenue when it transfers control of a product or
            service to a customer.                                                
                                                                                  
            When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, the Company
            evaluates whether it has an obligation to provide the specified service itself (i.e. the Company is
            the principle) or to arrange for those services to be provided by the other party (i.e. the Company
            is the agent). Where the Company does not control the service, the Company is considered an
            agent in the transaction.                                             
                                                                                  
            Revenues primarily comprise sale of services that enable customers to communicate by mobile
            phone with their customers. To be able to render these services, the Company needs to obtain
            services from one or more telecommunication operators. Cost incurred that are directly related
            to fulfilling a specified contract with a customer are regarded as a contract fulfilment cost and
            are expensed in the period in which the related revenue is recognised.
            The services rendered are split into the following groups:

                        Messenger, WhatsApp and email. Revenue and value added tax.
                        from messaging is recognised when                         
                        the message service has been provided;                    
                        when the messages are delivered to the                    
                        recipient.

            The consolidated financial statements are presented in NOK, which is theCompany’s functional
            currency. In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in
            currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recognised at the rate of exchange
            on the date of the transaction. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are
            denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary
            items carried at fair value in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate at the
            date when the fair value was measured. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of
            historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated after the transaction date.
            Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents
            are presented in the income statement as financial items. All other foreign exchange gains
            and losses are presented on a net basis in the income statement as other operating expenses.
            Exchange differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
                                                                                  
            For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of
            the Company’s foreign operations are translated to NOK at exchange rates on the reporting
            date. Income and expense items are translated to NOK at the average exchange rates for
            the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the
            exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are
            recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of
            equity.                                                               
                                                                                  
            Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are
            considered as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. These
            exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.

            foreign operation, all of the exchange differences accumulated in a separate component
            of equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the foreign operation are
            reclassified to the income statement. In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary
            that includes a foreign operation that does not result in the Company losing control over the
            subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences is re-attributed to
            non-controlling interests and are not recognised in profit or loss.

            Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised initially as
            set out in 3.4 Business Combinations above.                           
                                                                                  
            Amortisation of intangible assets are based on the following estimated useful lives:
            Goodwill            Indefinite                                        
            Tradename           25 year                                           
            Customer relations/contracts 7-10                                     
            Technology          3-10 years                                        
            Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently
            when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated,
            may be impaired. Goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s cash-generating units (or
            groups of cash-generating units) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If
            the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit,
            the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated
            to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount
            of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a
            subsequent period. On disposal of a cash generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is
            included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal in the income statement.
            Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill,
            such as Tradename and Customer relations are recognised initially at their fair value at the
            acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).                   
                                                                                  
            Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination
            are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
            Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The
            estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting
            period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
            Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated impairment
            losses.                                                               
                                                                                  
            Separately acquired intangible assets                                 
            Intangible assets with finite useful lives such as Technology, that are acquired separately
            are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
            Subsequent to initial recognition, separately acquired intangible assets are reported at cost
            less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as
            intangible assets that are acquired in a business combination.

            Internally generated intangible assets – Technology                   
                                                                                  
            Expenditure on research and development activities is recognised as an expense in the period
            in which it is incurred. An internally generated intangible asset arising from development of
            the Company’s technical platforms and products is recognised if, and only if, all the following
            conditions have been demonstrated:                                    
                                                                                  
            y the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use
             or sale;                                                             
            y the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;  
                                                                                  
            y the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;                    
            y how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
                                                                                  
            y the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the
             development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and             
            y the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its
                                                                                  
             development.                                                         
            The amount initially recognised for internally generated intangible assets is the sum of the
            expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria
            listed above. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development
            expenditures are expensed as incurred.                                
            Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost
            less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as
            intangible assets that are acquired in a business combination.        
                                                                                  
            3.9 Equipment and fixtures                                            
                                                                                  
            Equipment and fixtures are initially recognised at cost, which includes the purchase price
            (including duties and non-refundable purchase taxes) and any directly attributable costs of
            bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be able to operate in the
            intended manner. Equipment and fixtures are subsequently recognised at cost less accumulated
            depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is recognised using the
            straight-line method to reduce the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful
            lives. Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
            Estimated useful life, depreciation method and residual values are reviewed at least annually.
            The straight-line depreciation method is used as this best reflects the consumption of the
            assets, which often is the passage of time. Residual value is estimated to be zero for all assets.
                                                                                  
            Repair and maintenance are expensed as incurred. If new parts are capitalised, replaced parts
            are derecognised and any remaining net carrying amount is recognised in operating profit (loss)
            as loss on disposal.

            An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future
            economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss
            arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of equipment and fixtures is determined as the
            difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is presented
            as other income or other expenses in the income statement.            
                                                                                  
            3.10 Impairment of non-financial assets                               
            At each reporting date, the Company reviews if there are any indicators that the carrying
            amounts of its tangible and intangible assets may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the
            recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss
            (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets,
            the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset
            belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate
            assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to
            the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation
            basis can be identified.                                              
                                                                                  
            Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least
            annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
                                                                                  
            Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In
            assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
            using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
            money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not
            been adjusted.                                                        
            If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its
            carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its
            recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
                                                                                  
            Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-
            generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that
            the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
            determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in
            prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless
            the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment
            loss is treated as a revaluation increase. Any impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not
            reversed in a subsequent period.                                      
                                                                                  
            3.11 Leases                                                           
            The Company initially applied IFRS 16 from 01 January 2019; IFRS 16 was applied using the
            modified retrospective approach. At the inception of a contract, the company assesses whether
            the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the
            right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
            The lease liability is recognized at the commencement date and measured at the present value
            of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the company’s incremental borrowing rate

            environment.                                                          
                                                                                  
            The Company has chosen to measure the Right-of-Use asset (RoU assets) at an amount
            equal to the lease liability for all leases by using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate; the
            rate may differ from country to country. RoU assets are depreciated over the lease term as
            this is ordinarily shorter than the useful life of the assets. The lease term represents the non-
            cancellable period of the lease, together with periods covered by an option either to extend
            or to terminate the lease when the company is reasonably certain to exercise this option. The
            Company applies the exemption for short term leases (12 months or less) and low value leases.
            As such, related lease payments are not recognized in the balance sheet but expensed or
            capitalized in line with the accounting treatment for other non-lease expenses. The inclusion of
            non-lease components may vary across different lease categories.      
                                                                                  
            3.12 Government grants                                                
            The Company receives Government grant as part of the “Skattefunn” arrangement in Norway,
            which is an arrangement to stimulate research and development in Norway. The government
            grant is initially recognised as a deduction to the carrying amount of the relevant asset. The
            amount is subsequently recognised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the
            estimated useful life of the related asset.

            estimation variances                                                  
                                                                                  
            In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, as described in note 3 (summary of
            significant accounting policies), management is required to make judgments, estimates and
            assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
            Estimates and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical
            experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are considered to be
            relevant. Future events may cause these estimates to change and actual results may differ from
            these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
                                                                                  
            Changes in accounting estimates are recognised in the period when the changes occurred,
            if they apply to that period. If the changes also apply to future periods, the effect will be
            distributed between the current period and future periods.            
                                                                                  
            Business combinations                                                 
            The Company has finalised certain acquisitions in FY2021; refer to note 5 (business
            combinations) for further details. In order to account for the business combinations and
            determine the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities in accordance with IFRS 3,
            management has used significant judgement. In order to calculate the fair value of the
            intangible assets in the acquired companies, the expected future cash flows have been

            reconciled to the purchase price of the acquired companies. The reconciliation is performed
            via a Business Enterprise Valuation (BEV). Intangible assets have been valued using the Multi
            Excess Earnings Method (“MEEM”) and Relief From Royalty Method (“RFR”). The methods
            are considered to be appropriate for the type of assets being valued (MEEM for customer
            relationships and RFR for technology and trade name). The excess of the consideration over the
            fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
                                                                                  
            Significant input used in the estimation of fair values utilising the above methods are as follows:
                                                                                  
            y The remaining estimated useful life of customer relationships is between 7 and 10 years
            y The remaining estimated useful life of technology is 10 years       
                                                                                  
            y Revenue growth and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation)
             margins are based on estimates of growth and margins in the respective companies
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
            Estimated impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets          
            The carrying amounts of non-current tangible and intangible assets are assessed by means of
            impairment tests whenever there is an indication of impairment. Any impairment of goodwill
            is assessed at least annually. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been
            determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require management to
            estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable
            discount rate in order to calculate present value. As of 31 December 2021, the amount of
            goodwill tested for impairment amounted to KNOK 5 614 510 (FY2020 - KNOK 3 982 843). No
            impairment losses were recognised in FY2021 (FY2020 - nil). Please refer to notes 3 (summary
            of significant accounting policies) and 13 (intangible assets) for further details related to the
            impairment testing methodology and results.                           
                                                                                  
            Deferred tax assets                                                   
                                                                                  
            Management judgment is required in determining provisions for income taxes, deferred
            tax assets and liabilities and the extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized.
            The Company is also subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. Judgment is required
            in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes. There may be transactions and
            calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course
            of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that
            were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax liability and
            expense in the period in which such determination is made.            
                                                                                  
            Purchase price of subsidiaries – earn-out                             
            Periodically, the Company acquires subsidiaries where the preliminary purchase price is
            based on an assumption that the acquired company will achieve a target EBITDA for the
            current financial year. The final purchase price is subject to an upwards or downwards earn-
            out adjustment based on the company’s actual achieved EBITDA. The earn-out adjustment is
            accounted for in the income statement as finance income or expense.

            amortised cost less loss allowances.                                  
                                                                                  
            All financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost.             
                                                                                  
            The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value as at 31 December
            2021. Arrangements with financial institutions are entered into on market terms, and the carrying value
            at the reporting date has been assessed as approximating fair value.  
            The recognised amounts consitute a reasonable approximation of fair value.

            ¹ The bond loan is initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs and it is subsequently
             measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Consequently, the transaction
             cost will be amortized over the life of the bond loan. The carrying value of the bond loan will be equal to
             the principal amount of EUR 370 million at maturity in FY2025.

            million. The bonds were issued at par.                                
                                                                                  
            The bonds have a 5-year tenor and a fixed coupon of 3.375% p.a.; any outstanding bonds are

            Interest rate risk arises as a consequence of long-term debt. In December 2020 the Company
            successfully completed the issuance of EUR 200 million senior unsecured bonds, with a EUR
            350 million borrowing limit.                                          
                                                                                  
            On 23 June 2021, LINK issued EUR 170 million new bonds in LINK’s outstanding 5-year senior
            unsecured 3.375% fixed rate bond issue, raising the total outstanding amount to EUR 370
            million. The bonds were issued at par; refer to note 11 for further details.
            The sensitivity analysis below is based on the exposure to changes in interest rates for non-
            derivative instruments at the reporting date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared
            assuming the amount outstanding at reporting date was outstanding for the whole year. A
            one percent increase or decrease represents management’s assessment of reasonable and
            possible changes in interest rates.                                   
                                                                                  
            If interest rates had been one percent higher/lower and all other variables were held constant,
            the Company’s profit (and corresponding equity) for the period ended 31 December 2021 would
            decrease/increase by KNOK 36 959 (FY2020 KNOK 20 941). This is mainly attributable to the
            Company’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings. 
                                                                                  
            Foreign exchange risk                                                 
            The Company is a holding company and does not actively undertake business in foreign
            currencies; as a consequence, exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates is limited. Foreign
            exchange risk arises from transactions related to operations conducted, and assets and
            liabilities arising in foreign currencies.

          We have been the auditor of the Company for 3 years from the election by the general meeting of the
          shareholders on 17 September 2019 for the accounting year 2019.

          Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in
          our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the
          context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we
          do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The Company’s and the Group’s business activities
          have remained largely unchanged during 2021. Impairment of goodwill has approximately the same
          risks and characteristics as last year and continues to be in our focus.

          Other Information                                                       
                                                                                  
          The Board of Directors and the Managing Director (management) are responsible for the information
          in the Board of Directors’ report and the other information accompanying the financial statements.
          The other information comprises information in the annual report, but does not include the financial
          statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover
          the information in the Board of Directors’ report nor the other information accompanying the financial
          statements.                                                             
          In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Board of
          Directors’ report and the other information accompanying the financial statements. The purpose is to
          consider if there is material inconsistency between the Board of Directors’ report and the other
          information accompanying the financial statements and the financial statements or our knowledge
          obtained in the audit, or whether the Board of Directors’ report and the other information
          accompanying the financial statements otherwise appears to be materially misstated. We are required
          to report if there is a material misstatement in the Board of Directors’ report or the other information
          accompanying the financial statements. We have nothing to report in this regard.
          Based on our knowledge obtained in the audit, it is our opinion that the Board of Directors’ report
            •  is consistent with the financial statements and                    
                                                                                  
            •  contains the information required by applicable legal requirements.
                                                                                  
          Our opinion on the Board of Director’s report applies correspondingly to the statements on Corporate
          Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility.                         
                                                                                  
          Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements             
                                                                                  
          Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in
          accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such
          internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
          statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
          In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s and the
          Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
          concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to
          liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
                                                                                  
          Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements    
          Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
          are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report
          that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
          that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it
          exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                       (3)

          aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
          basis of these financial statements.                                    
          As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
          professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:                  
                                                                                  
            •  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due
               to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
               obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
               risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
               resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
               misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.           
            •  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
               procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
               opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's or the Group's internal control.
                                                                                  
            •  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
               estimates and related disclosures made by management.              
            •  conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of
               accounting, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
               related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company and the
               Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty
               exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in
               the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our
               conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
               However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to
               continue as a going concern.                                       
            •  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including
               the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions
               and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair view.         
            •  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
               or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
               statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group
               audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.         
          We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
          timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
          control that we identify during our audit.                              
                                                                                  
          We also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
          requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other
          matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related
          safeguards.                                                             
          From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of
          most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the
          key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                      (4)
