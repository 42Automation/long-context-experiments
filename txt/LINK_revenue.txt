            Comments     related to the financial  statements

            In accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act §3.3.a the Board confirms that the
            company fulfils the requirements necessary to operate as a going concern and the 2020
            financial statements have been prepared on the basis of that assumption. As a listed
            company, LINK Mobility Group Holding ASA prepared the consolidated financial statements

            for the financial year 2020 in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting
            Standards) as adopted by the European Union.

            Acquisitions
            On 16th November 2020, LINK announced signing and closing of the acquisition of the
            Austrian CPaaS companies SMS.AT and ATMS operating under the WebSMS brand. WebSMS

            holds an MNO license in Austria and is considered the local market leader, with more than
            5000 enterprise clients. WebSMS also has significant business in Germany and Switzerland.

            Revenue, costs, and profits
            LINK reported revenue of NOK 3 539 million in 2020, an increase of 22% from NOK 2 890 in
            2019. LINK’s gross margin was NOK 899 million (NOK 753 million).

            Operating costs (including payroll and related services and other operating expenses)
            were NOK 606 million (NOK 542 million) and include non-recurring costs of NOK 97 million
            connected to restructuring, share based compensation and acquisitions. Depreciation and
            amortization were NOK 271 million (NOK 247 million).

            Net financial items amounted to a negative NOK 427 million (NOK 194 million), whereof
            interest and other financial expenses amounting to NOK 326 million were primarily related to
            LINK’s Senior Facility Agreement (SFA). The SFA was refinanced in December 2020 with the
            issuance of a 5-year EUR 200 million bond. There was a negative currency effect of NOK 101
            million in 2020.

            LINK’s total tax expense was a positive NOK 77 million (negative NOK 2 million). The net loss
            for the year was NOK 328 million (negative NOK 233 million).
