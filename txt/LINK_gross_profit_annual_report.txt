         The Group reports revenue, gross margin (revenue less direct costs) and adjusted EBITDA in functional operating
         segments to the Board of Directors (the Group’s chief operating decision makers). While LINK uses all four measures
         to analyze performance, the Group’s strategy of profitable growth means that adjusted EBITDA is the prevailing
         measure of performance (refer to alternate performance measures).
         An examination of operating units based on market maturity and product development as well as geography identifies
         four natural reporting segments. These are the Nordics, Western Europe, Central Europe, and Global Messaging; these
         represent market clusters. Generally, regions are segregated into similar geographic locations as these follow similar
         market trends. Common routing includes all regions with aggregator traffic; the other three have enterprise traffic.

         The Nordics
         The Nordics is comprised of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland.

         Central Europe
         Central Europe is comprised of Bulgaria, Romania, North Macedonia, Poland, Hungary, Germany, and Austria.

         Western Europe
         Western Europe is comprised of Spain, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy.

         Global Messaging
         Global messaging is comprised of non-enterprise traffic and is representative of either stand-alone business or as
         a component of revenues in countries included above. If a business is comprised of both enterprise and wholesale/
         aggregator transactions, the latter is segregated here. The Swiss operation Horisen Messaging is included here.

         Wholesale/aggregator business is defined as an operating unit within LINK’s industry, and that use LINK connections
         in markets where they do not have such connections themselves. This business can generally be referred to, at least
         partly, as a direct competitor that use LINK connections. Smaller local aggregators cannot be expected to be covered
         efficiently by Global Messaging and as such they are still subject to local management.
