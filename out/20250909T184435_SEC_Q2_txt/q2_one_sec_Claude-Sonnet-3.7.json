  "output": "Based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, I cannot determine which year had the biggest operating expenditure for Apple. The document primarily focuses on fiscal year 2024 with some comparative data for 2023 and 2022, but doesn't provide a comprehensive historical view of operating expenditures across all years of Apple's history.\n\nFrom the data available in the document, I can see that:\n- For fiscal year 2024, total operating expenses were $57,467 million\n- For fiscal year 2023, total operating expenses were $54,847 million\n- For fiscal year 2022, total operating expenses were $51,345 million\n\nAmong these three years, 2024 had the highest operating expenses, but I cannot determine if this represents the highest operating expenditure in Apple's entire history.",
