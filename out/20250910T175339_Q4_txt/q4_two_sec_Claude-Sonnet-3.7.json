  "expected_answer": "Vesting is contingent upon the achievement of specific company performance metrics. In this case, it's tied to Apple's relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) percentile performance compared to a defined group of peer companies over a predetermined performance period.",
  "output": "Based on the document, the vesting conditions for performance awards in Apple's 2022 Employee Stock Plan are determined by the Company's relative total shareholder return (TSR) Percentile for the Performance Period. The document shows this in Exhibit A of the Performance Award agreement (Exhibit 10.22).\n\nSpecifically, the percentage of RSUs (restricted stock units) that vest depends on where Apple's TSR Percentile ranks compared to certain threshold percentiles:\n\n- If Apple's TSR Percentile is at a certain percentile or greater (specific percentile redacted in the document with \"[  ]\"), a certain percentage of target RSUs will vest\n- If Apple's TSR Percentile is at lower specified percentiles, correspondingly lower percentages of target RSUs will vest\n- For TSR Percentile performance between the specified levels, the portion of RSUs that vest is determined on a straight-line basis (linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages\n\nThe document also notes that if Apple's TSR for the Performance Period is negative, no more than one hundred percent (100%) of the target RSUs will vest, regardless of the TSR Percentile ranking.",
