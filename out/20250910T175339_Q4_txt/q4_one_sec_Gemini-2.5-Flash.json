  "output": "For performance awards under Apple's 2022 Employee Stock Plan, the vesting conditions are determined by the Company's relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) Percentile for the specified Performance Period.\n\nThe percentage of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) that vest depends on where the Company's TSR Percentile ranks. However, if the Company's TSR for the Performance Period is negative, no more than 100% of the target RSUs will vest.",
