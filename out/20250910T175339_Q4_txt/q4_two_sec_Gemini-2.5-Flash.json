  "doc_urls": null,
  "expected_answer": "Vesting is contingent upon the achievement of specific company performance metrics. In this case, it's tied to Apple's relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) percentile performance compared to a defined group of peer companies over a predetermined performance period.",
  "output": "Based on the \"2022 Employee Stock Plan Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement - Performance Award\" (Exhibit 10.20), the vesting conditions for performance awards are determined by the **Company's relative total shareholder return (\"TSR\") Percentile for the Performance Period**.\n\nSpecifically, Exhibit A, \"Performance Vesting Requirements,\" states:\n*   The percentage of RSUs that vest is based on a tiered schedule tied to the Company's TSR Percentile (e.g., if TSR Percentile is at a certain percentile or greater, a specific percentage of target RSUs will vest).\n*   For performance between the indicated levels, the vesting percentage is determined on a straight-line (linearly interpolated) basis.\n*   If the Company's TSR for the Performance Period is negative, no more than 100% of the target RSUs will vest.\n\nKey terms defined for this determination include:\n*   **TSR Percentile:** The percentile ranking of the Company's TSR among the TSRs for the Comparison Group members for the Performance Period.\n*   **Comparison Group:** The Company and each other company included in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index on the first day of the Performance Period.\n*   **TSR (Total Shareholder Return):** Calculated by dividing the sum of (i) the difference between the Ending Price and Beginning Price and (ii) all dividends and other distributions during the Performance Period, by the Beginning Price. Dividends and distributions are treated as reinvested.\n*   **Beginning Price:** The average of the closing market prices of the company's common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days beginning with the first trading day of the Performance Period.\n*   **Ending Price:** The average of the closing market prices of the company's common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the Performance Period.",
