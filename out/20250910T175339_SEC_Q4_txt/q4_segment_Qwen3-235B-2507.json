  "expected_answer": "Vesting is contingent upon the achievement of specific company performance metrics. In this case, it's tied to Apple's relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) percentile performance compared to a defined group of peer companies over a predetermined performance period.",
  "output": "The vesting conditions for performance awards in Apple's 2022 Employee Stock Plan are determined by the **Company\u2019s relative total shareholder return (TSR) Percentile** compared to a **Comparison Group** over a specified **Performance Period**.\n\nKey factors that determine vesting:\n\n1. **TSR Percentile Ranking**:  \n   - The Company\u2019s TSR is calculated and ranked as a percentile against the TSRs of companies in the **Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index** (the \"Comparison Group\") at the start of the Performance Period.\n   - If Apple\u2019s TSR Percentile meets or exceeds certain predefined thresholds (e.g., 50th, 75th, 90th percentiles), a corresponding percentage of the target RSUs will vest.\n\n2. **Performance-Based Vesting Schedule**:  \n   - Vesting is based on a sliding scale:\n     - If TSR Percentile \u2265 [X] \u2192 [Y]% of RSUs vest.\n     - Intermediate performance results in **linear interpolation** between the nearest vesting percentages.\n     - If TSR Percentile < [Z] \u2192 0% of RSUs vest (no vesting below threshold).\n   - Even if Apple ranks high, **if the absolute TSR is negative**, no more than **100%** of the target RSUs can vest.\n\n3. **Definitions and Adjustments**:\n   - **TSR** = [(Ending Price \u2013 Beginning Price) + Dividends (reinvested)] / Beginning Price.\n   - **Beginning Price** and **Ending Price** are based on 20-day average closing prices at the start and end of the Performance Period.\n   - Adjustments are made for stock splits, dividends, mergers, bankruptcies, or other corporate events to ensure fairness.\n\n4. **Final Determination**:\n   - The **Committee** (typically the Compensation Committee of the Board) has final authority to interpret and determine outcomes in case of ambiguity.\n\nIn summary, **vesting depends on Apple\u2019s stock performance relative to the S&P 500 over the Performance Period**, with payout ranging from 0% to 100% (or capped at 100% if TSR is negative) based on percentile ranking.",
