  "expected_answer": "Vesting is contingent upon the achievement of specific company performance metrics. In this case, it's tied to Apple's relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) percentile performance compared to a defined group of peer companies over a predetermined performance period.",
  "output": "Based on the provided Form 10-K, the vesting conditions for performance awards under Apple's 2022 Employee Stock Plan are determined by the **Company's relative total shareholder return (TSR) Percentile** for a specified **Performance Period**.\n\nThe specific details are outlined in **Exhibit A** of the \"Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award - Performance Award\" document (Exhibit 10.20 and Exhibit 10.22) included in the filing.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the key factors:\n\n1.  **Performance Metric:** The primary metric is the **Company\u2019s relative total shareholder return (TSR) Percentile**. This measures how Apple's stock performance ranks against a group of peer companies (the \"Comparison Group,\" defined as the S&P 500) over the Performance Period.\n2.  **Performance Period:** The vesting is tied to a specific time frame, referred to as the \"Performance Period,\" which is defined in the individual grant notice.\n3.  **Vesting Schedule:** The percentage of the target RSUs that vest is determined by where Apple's TSR Percentile falls within predefined tiers. For example:\n    *   If the TSR Percentile is at or above a high threshold (e.g., 75th percentile), 100% of the target RSUs vest.\n    *   If the TSR Percentile is at a lower threshold (e.g., 50th percentile), a lower percentage (e.g., 50%) of the target RSUs vest.\n    *   If the TSR Percentile is below a minimum threshold (e.g., 25th percentile), 0% of the RSUs vest.\n    *   For performance between the tiers, the vesting percentage is determined by linear interpolation.\n4.  **Negative TSR Cap:** Even if the TSR Percentile is high, if the Company's overall TSR for the Performance Period is negative, no more than 100% of the target RSUs will vest.",
