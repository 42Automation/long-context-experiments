  "expected_answer": "The document does not explicitly state the duration of the Performance Period for the vesting of RSUs.",
  "output": "Based on the document, the performance period for vesting RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) in Apple's Stock Plan varies depending on the specific award agreement. The document shows multiple award agreements with different vesting schedules.\n\nFor standard RSUs (Exhibit 10.19), there appears to be a time-based vesting schedule where RSUs vest on specified \"Vesting Dates\" as set forth in the Grant Notice.\n\nFor Performance Awards (Exhibits 10.20 and 10.22), there is a specific \"Performance Period\" mentioned in the Notice of Grant section, but the exact length is not specified in the visible portions of the document. These Performance Awards vest based on the Company's relative total shareholder return (TSR) Percentile over the Performance Period, with vesting occurring on a specified \"Vesting Date\" after the Performance Period ends.\n\nThe document doesn't provide a standard or fixed length for the performance period across all awards.",
