         Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less
         accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis
         over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each
         reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible
         assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
         Separately acquired intangible assets                                    
         Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation
         and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent to initial recognition, separately acquired intangible assets are
         reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible
         assets that are acquired in a business combination.                      
                                                                                  
         Internally generated intangible assets – technology                      
         Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally-
         generated intangible asset arising from development of the Groups technical platforms and products is recognised if,
         and only if, all the following conditions have been demonstrated:        
         y the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
         y the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;     
                                                                                  
         y the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;                       
         y how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
         y the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell
          the intangible asset; and                                               
         y the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
         The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from
         the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally generated
         intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is
         incurred.                                                                
                                                                                  
         Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated
         amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired in a
         business combination.                                                    
         3.8 Equipment and fixtures                                               
         Equipment and fixtures are initially recognised at cost, which includes the purchase price (including duties and non-
         refundable purchase taxes) and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition
         necessary for it to be able to operate in the intended manner. Equipment and fixtures are subsequently recognised at
         cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is recognised so as to
         reduce the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method. Depreciation
         commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.              
                                                                                  
         Estimated useful life, depreciation method and residual values are reviewed at least annually. The straight-line
         depreciation method is used as this best reflects the consumption of the assets, which often is the passage of time.
         Residual value is estimated to be zero for all assets.                   
                                                                                  
         Repair and maintenance is expensed as incurred. If new parts are capitalised, replaced parts are derecognised and
         any remaining net carrying amount is recognised in operating profit (loss) as loss on disposal.
         An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are

         Adjusted EBITDA means EBITDA adjusted by expenses related to significant one-time, non-recurring events such as
         acquisitions and restructuring activities, legal advisors, and share-based compensation. LINK has presented adjusted
         EBITDA in the consolidated statement of profit and loss because management believes the measure provides useful
         information regarding operating performance.

         EBITDA means earnings before interest, taxes, amortization, depreciation, and impairments. LINK has presented
         EBITDA in the consolidated statement of profit and loss because management believes that the measure provides
         useful information regarding the Group’s ability to service debt and to fund capital expenditures and provides a
         helpful measure for comparing its operating performance with that of other companies.

         3.3 Principles of consolidation                                          
         The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries,
         which are entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when the Group has power over the investee, is
         exposed, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power
         to affect its returns. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate
         that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control noted above. The financial statements of the
         subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting periods as the parent company and consistent accounting policies
         are applied. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement
         from the date when control is obtained and until control ceases, respectively. Intercompany transactions, balances,
         revenues, expenses and unrealised Group internal gains or losses are eliminated on consolidation.
                                                                                  
         When the group ceases to consolidate an investee because of a loss of control, any retained interest in the entity is
         remeasured to its fair value with the change in the carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value of the
         retained interest becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the investment.
                                                                                  
         3.4 Business combinations                                                
         Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred and all the
         identifiable assets and liabilities of acquired entities are measured at fair values at the date of acquisition, except
         deferred tax assets or liabilities and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements, which are
         recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively.
         Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.  
                                                                                  
         Goodwill is measured at the amount by which the total consideration transferred exceeds the net fair value of assets
         acquired. Goodwill is not amortised, but its value is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when
         there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, may be impaired. Goodwill
         is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash generating units) that is expected to
         benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its
         carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any
         impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not
         reversed in subsequent periods.                                          
                                                                                  
         When the consideration transferred by the Company in a business combination includes contingent consideration
         arrangements, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of
         the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that
         qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments recognised
         in goodwill. Measurement period adjustments arise from additional information obtained during the ‘measurement
         period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the
         acquisition date. The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not
         qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent
         consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent
         settlement is accounted for within equity. Other contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at subsequent
         reporting dates with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.

         3.8 Equipment and fixtures                                               
         Equipment and fixtures are initially recognised at cost, which includes the purchase price (including duties and non-
         refundable purchase taxes) and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition
         necessary for it to be able to operate in the intended manner. Equipment and fixtures are subsequently recognised at
         cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is recognised so as to
         reduce the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method. Depreciation
         commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.              
         Estimated useful life, depreciation method and residual values are reviewed at least annually. The straight-line
         depreciation method is used as this best reflects the consumption of the assets, which often is the passage of time.
         Residual value is estimated to be zero for all assets.                   
                                                                                  
         Repair and maintenance is expensed as incurred. If new parts are capitalised, replaced parts are derecognised and
         any remaining net carrying amount is recognised in operating profit (loss) as loss on disposal.
                                                                                  
         An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
         expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an
         item of equipment and fixtures is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount
         of the asset and is presented as other income or other expenses in the income statement.
         3.9 Impairment of non-financial assets                                   
         At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible
         assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
         indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if
         any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Company estimates
         the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent
         basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or
         otherwise they are allocated to the smallest Company of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent
         allocation basis can be identified.                                      
         Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever
         there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.                   
                                                                                  
         Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
         estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
         market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future
         cash flows have not been adjusted.                                       
                                                                                  
         If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
         carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
         recognised immediately in profit or loss.                                
                                                                                  
         Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is
         increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not
         exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset
         (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss,
         unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated
         as a revaluation increase. Any impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
