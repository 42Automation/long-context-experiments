Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        In addition, in recent years, the Oslo Stock Exchange has experienced wide price and volume fluctuations. For instance,
        the Oslo Børs All Share Index, which consists of all shares listed on Oslo Børs, decreased by approximately 33%, 17%
        and 11% between 21 February 2020 and 15 March 2020, 29 September 2018 and 27 December 2018, and 4 January
        2016 and 21 January 2016. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many
        companies. Those changes may occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies. The Company
        cannot assure that the market price of the Shares will not decline, and the Shares may trade at prices significantly below
        the Offer Price, regardless of the Group’s actual operating performance.  
        2.5.2 Future sales, or the possibility for future sales, including by existing shareholders, of substantial number of
              shares may affect the Shares’ market price                          
        The market price of the Shares could decline as a result of sales of a large number of Shares in the market or the
        perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, might also make it
        more difficult for the Company to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that it deems appropriate.
        The Company cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales of the Shares, or the availability of Shares for future sales,
        will have on their market price. In particular, even assuming full exercise of the Over-allotment Option, Victory Partners
        VIII Limited will continue to hold approximately 35% of the Shares after the completion of the Offering. If Victory
        Partners VIII Limited were to sale their Shares in large quantities after the Offering, or there were a perception that this
        may happen in the foreseeable future, the market price of the Shares could materially decline.
        2.6   Risks relating to the Offering and the Listing                      
        2.6.1 Following the Offering, Victory Partners VIII Limited will continue to be a large shareholder and may control
              or otherwise influence important actions the Group takes            
        Upon the completion of the Offering, Victory Partners VIII Limited will continue to be the largest shareholder of the
        Company. Victory Partners VIII Limited will be in a position to exercise considerable influence over all matters requiring
        shareholder approval. These matters include the authorization of any proposed capital increase and profit distribution,
        corporate mergers and sales involving all or nearly all of the Group's assets. Victory Partners VIII Limited may also be
        able to influence the direction of the Group’s operations and other affairs through its representation on the Board of
        Directors. This concentration of share ownership could have the effect of delaying, postponing or preventing a change
        of control in the Company, and impact mergers, consolidations, acquisitions or other forms of combinations, which may
        or may not be desired by other shareholders. No assurances can be given that the interests of Victory Partners VIII
        Limited or the investors who directly or indirectly control Victory Partners VIII Limited will not differ from the interests
        of other shareholders.                                                    
        The interests of Victory Partners VIII Limited may not be aligned with the interests of minority shareholders with respect
        to such voting decisions. In addition, Victory Partners VIII Limited's share ownership may materially adversely affect the
        trading price of the Shares because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with a
        significant shareholder.                                                  
        2.6.2 The Shares are listed on an "if issued/if sold" basis until delivery of the Shares, which could result in all
              conditional trades being reversed                                   
        The Shares are expected to be listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on an "if issued/if sold" basis. Therefore, the Shares
        will be tradable on the Oslo Stock Exchange before the Shares are delivered to each investor. If the Underwriting
        Agreement is terminated due to certain force majeure events, or if there is a default by Managers in certain
        circumstances, the Shares will not be delivered to the investors. All prior trades with the Shares will be cancelled and
        reversed, and any payments made will be returned without interest or other compensation. Such events could adversely
        affect participants in the Offering and those who trade in the Shares during the period of conditional trading. The
        Managers, the Company and the Selling Shareholders do not accept any responsibility or liability for any loss incurred
        by any person as a result of a termination of the Offering or (the related) annulment of any transactions on the Oslo
        Stock Exchange during the period of conditional trading.                  
        2.6.3 Although the Company does not expect to be a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal
              income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be a PFIC for any taxable year,
              which could subject United States investors in the Shares to significant adverse U.S. federal income tax
              consequences                                                        
        The Company does not expect to be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the current taxable year or in the
        foreseeable future. However, whether the Company is a PFIC will be determined annually based upon the composition
        and nature of its income, and the composition, nature and valuation of its assets (including goodwill), all of which are
        subject to change (including in the current taxable year). The composition and valuation of the Company’s assets may
        be determined in large part by reference to the market value of the Shares, which may be volatile. The determination
        of whether the Company is a PFIC will also depend upon the application of complex U.S. federal income tax rules
        concerning the classification of the Company’s assets (including goodwill) and income for this purpose, and the
        application of these rules is uncertain in some respects. Accordingly no assurance can be provided that the IRS will not
        successfully assert that the Company has been or will be a PFIC for the current year or any subsequent taxable year for
        U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company will not provide annual determinations regarding its PFIC status for any
        taxable year.                                                             
        If the Company is classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder (as defined in "United States Federal
        Income Tax Considerations") holds the Shares, such U.S. Holder may incur significantly increased U.S. federal income
        tax on gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of the Shares and on the receipt of certain distributions on the
        Shares. See the discussion under "United States Federal Income Tax Considerations — Passive Foreign Investment
        Company Rules" concerning the U.S. federal income tax considerations of owning and disposing of the Shares if the
        Company is or becomes classified as a PFIC, including the possibility of making certain elections.

Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        4.2.3 Non-IFRS financial measures                                         
        In this Prospectus, the Group presents certain alternative performance measures ("APMs"), including Churn Rate, Gross
        Profit, Gross Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Profit Conversion,
        Revenue Net Retention Rate and Like-for-Like Revenue. The APMs presented herein are not measurements of financial
        performance or liquidity under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, are not audited and investors
        should not consider any such measures to be an alternative to (a) operating revenues or operating profit (as determined
        in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), (b) as a measure of the Group's operating performance;
        or (c) any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. The APMs presented herein
        may not be indicative of the Group's historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of the
        Group's future results.                                                   
        The Group believes that APMs are commonly reported by companies in the markets in which it competes and are widely
        used by investors in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to factors such as depreciation and
        amortisation, which can vary significantly, depending upon accounting methods (particularly when acquisitions have
        occurred) or based on non-operating factors. Accordingly, the Group discloses Churn Rate, Gross Profit, Gross Margin,
        EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Profit Conversion, Revenue Net
        Retention Rate and Like-for-Like Revenue herein to permit a more complete and comprehensive analysis of its underlying
        operating performance relative to other companies and across periods, and of the Group's ability to service its debt.
        Because companies may calculate Churn Rate, Gross Profit, Gross Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
        Margin, LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Profit Conversion, Revenue Net Retention Rate and Like-for-Like Revenue
        differently, the Group's presentation of these APMs may not be comparable to similar titled measures used by other
        companies.                                                                
        The Group defines "Churn Rate" as revenue of customers that were a customer in the prior period but were not a
        customer at the beginning of the current period divided by the total revenue of the prior period.
        The group defines "Gross Profit" as revenue less direct costs of services rendered.
        The Group defines "Gross Margin" as revenue less direct costs divided by revenue.
        The Group defines "EBITDA" as operating profit (loss) adding back depreciation and amortisation.
        The Group defines "Adjusted EBITDA" as EBITDA adjusted for mergers and acquisitions costs, restructuring costs and
        costs related to share option program.                                    
        The Group defines "Adjusted EBITDA Margin" as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of operating revenues in the
        respective periods.                                                       
        The Group defines "Like-for-Like Revenue" as revenue recorded in an audited or reviewed period excluding the
        revenue from acquired entities in such period.                            
        The Group defined "LTM Adjusted EBITDA" as Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months from the end of the period
        The Group defines "Gross Profit Conversion" as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Gross Profit.
        The Group defines "Net Customer Expansion Rate" as the revenue generated from customers at the end of the period
        with their corresponding revenue from the same period in the previous year.
        The Group defines "Revenue Net Retention Rate" as revenue from the net of upsale, downsale and churn for
        customers throughout the period, not taking into account new customers during the period. Revenue Net Retention Rate
        excludes the acquisitions of TeraComm Group and Spothit.                  
        For an overview of reconciliation and calculation of the relevant APMs, please see Section 10.7 "Non-IFRS financial
        measures".                                                                
        4.2.4 Industry and market data                                            
        This Prospectus contains statistics, data, statements and other information relating to markets, market sizes, market
        shares, market positions and other industry data pertaining to the Group’s business and the industries and markets in
        which it operates. Unless otherwise indicated, such information reflects the Group’s estimates based on analysis of
        multiple sources, including data compiled by professional organisations, consultants and analysts and information
        otherwise obtained from other third party sources, such as annual and interim financial statements and other
        presentations published by listed companies operating within the same industry as the Group, as well as the Group’s
        internal data and its own experience, or on a combination of the foregoing. Unless otherwise indicated in the Prospectus,
        the basis for any statements regarding the Group’s competitive position is based on the Company’s own assessment and
        knowledge of the market in which it operates.                             
        The Company confirms that where information has been sourced from a third party, such information has been accurately
        reproduced and that as far as the Company is aware and is able to ascertain from information published by that third
        party, no facts have been omitted that would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Where
        information sourced from third parties has been presented, the source of such information has been identified. The
        Company does not intend, and does not assume any obligations to update industry or market data set forth in this
        Prospectus.                                                               
        Industry publications or reports generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources
        believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. The Company has not

               Like-for-Like Revenue(b) ........................................................... 1,613.6 965.3 2,128.7 1,387.9 1,255.4
                   (a)   Acquisition Revenue is defined as revenue generated by the acquired entities for the periods indicated. The Company
                         considers Acquisition Revenue any revenue generated by acquired entities for four full consecutive quarters after
                         complete ownership by the Company of such entity. From 1 January 2018 an acquired Spanish entity was merged
                         with an existing entity, hence the allocation of revenues between organic and acquired revenue is based on a
                         management estimate. In 2017 an acquired Danish entity was merged with an existing Danish entity, hence the
                         allocation between organic and acquired revenue is estimated. See Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions".
                   (b)   When comparing the Like-for-Like Revenue for a relevant period, the entities used for such calculation differ from
                         period to period, as the Company excludes revenues from companies acquired during the relevant periods in
                         calculating Like-for-Like Revenue. This methodology allows the Company to isolate and compare the revenue
                         generated by the companies that were operating for the full relevant period compared. See Section 11.3.2
                         "Acquisitions".                                          
                         When comparing the years ended 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2019, the Company excludes revenues from
                         companies acquired in 2019 and 2018, but includes the revenue from companies acquired in 2017, as the Company
                         no longer considers such revenue as Acquisition Revenue. The growth rate of Like-for-Like Revenue for the years
                         ended 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2019 increased from 1,956.9 to 2,128.7, an increase of 9%.
                         When comparing the years ended 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2018, the Company excludes revenues from
                         companies acquired in 2017 and 2018. The growth rate of Like-for-Like Revenue for the years ended 31 December
                         2017 to 31 December 2018 increased from 1,255.4 to 1,387.9, an increase of 11%.
           6   Gross Profit Conversion is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Gross Profit.
           7   Revenue Net Retention Rate is defined as revenue from the net of upsale, downsale and churn for customers throughout the period, not
               taking into account new customers during the year. Revenue Net Retention Rate excludes the acquisitions of TeraComm Group and Spothit.
               Excluding Spain, these figures are 116% and 111% for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and as of 31 December 2020, respectively. The
               data required to calculate these measures was not yet monitored in the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 and as a result
               comparatives for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 are not available.
           8   Churn Rate is defined as revenue of customers that were a customer in the prior period but were not a customer at the beginning of the
               current period divided by the total revenue of the prior period. The data required to calculate these measures was not yet monitored in the
               years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 and as a result comparatives for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 are not available.
           9   Net Customer Expansion Rate is defined as the revenue generated from customers at the end of the period with their corresponding revenue
               from the same period in the previous year.

        11.2.1 Descriptions of principal income statement items                   
        Descriptions of certain principal income statement items are set forth below.
        Operating revenue                                                         
        Revenues are recognised when services are rendered and measured based on the consideration to which the Group
        expects to be entitled in a contract with a customer net of discounts and sales related taxes. The Group recognises
        revenue when it transfers control of a product or service to a customer.  
        Total operating expenses                                                  
        Total operating expenses include expenses relating to services rendered, payroll and related expenses, other operating
        expenses and depreciation and amortisation. Other operating expenses include expenses for advisors and consultants;
        IT, licenses and hosting; restructuring costs; costs related to acquisition of subsidiaries; sales and marketing costs; cost
        for premises; inventory and equipment and other expenses.                 
        Finance income and expenses                                               
        Finance income and expenses is largely comprised of gains from foreign exchange. The finance expense for the period
        relates to interest expenses on borrowings, amortised cost recognised in profit and loss on debt to financial institutions
        and losses from foreign exchange.                                         
        Income tax                                                                
        Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
        11.3  Key factors affecting the Group’s results of operations             
        The Group’s results of operations, financial position and liquidity have been affected in the years under review, and are
        expected to continue to be affected, by certain principal factors and development relating to its business, including, in
        particular: acquisitions; general economic conditions; trends within the industry; ability to win and renew contracts;
        diversification of customer base; margins; contract pricing; cost of services, efficiency and utilisation; quarterly
        development and exchange rates.                                           
        Other than the factors described in this Section "Key factors affecting the Group’s results of operations", the Group does
        not consider any governmental, economic, fiscal, tax, monetary or political policy or factor individually to have had a
        material effect, directly or indirectly, on its operations in the years under review. See Section 2 "Risk factors" for
        information regarding any governmental, economic, fiscal, tax, monetary or political policies or factors that could
        materially affect, directly or indirectly, the Group’s operations in the future.
        11.3.1 Outbreak of COVID-19                                               
        In March 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group promptly undertook a number of initiatives
        to safeguard its employees and reduce operating costs while ensuring the continuity of the Group’s operations. In
        particular, the Group successfully transitioned substantially all of its employees to remote working over a short period
        of time while at the same time maintaining the full operation of all its centres, which are equipped with continuity and
        backup systems, full-service delivery of the Group’s services and complete business continuity services. The Group is

        revenue growth from such customers, demonstrated by a 111% Revenue Net Retention Rate in the six months ended
        30 June 2020 and 106% in the year ended 31 December 2019.                 
                                                                                  
        11.3.6 Direct relationships with mobile network operators, OTT-providers and financial services providers
        The Group’s direct relationships with mobile network operators, OTT-providers and financial services providers have a
        significant impact on the Group’s results of operations. The Group’s ability to source certain CPaaS and payments services
        can drive demand for The Group’s services, reduce the cost of services and provide a competitive advantage in certain
        markets. The Group has generally experienced a positive correlation between the number of its direct relationships and
        growth in revenue and gross margin.                                       
        In addition, certain CPaaS services provided by the Group require direct relationships with OTT providers. The contracts
        with the OTT providers enable the Group to supplement its traditional CPaaS messaging and voice services with OTT
        communication services and offer its customers omni-channel communication capabilities, thereby providing the Group
        with a competitive advantage vis-à-vis traditional CPaaS providers. In addition, the Group’s omni-channel
        communication capabilities also allow the Group to mitigate its communication services supplier risk and manage its
        communication-related cost of services as it can shift its messaging and voice services to different communication
        channels.                                                                 
        11.3.7 Platform costs and operating expenses                              
        The Group believes that to expand its business, it needs to continue to invest in development of its products and services.
        As its products and services have been primarily built in-house, it expects to continue to make significant investments
        in research and development activities that will enable the Group not to rely significantly on any third-party systems or
        service providers to provide its products and services and, consequently, to not make significant investments in
        integrating and maintaining third-party systems or resolving legacy system issues. The Group expects to realise cost
        savings through economies of scale, but may incur costs during phases of expansion and optimisation. For information
        relating to the Group's investments reference is made to Section 11.14 "Investments".
        11.3.8 Exchange rates                                                     
        The Group undertakes business in foreign currencies and is consequently exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates.
        Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions related to operations conducted, and assets and liabilities arising in
        foreign currencies. The Group undertakes transactions denominated in NOK, SEK, DKK, EUR, GBP, BGN, CHF, RON, MKD
        and PLN. Revenue and cost transactions within foreign subsidiaries are normally carried out in the same currency, which
        mitigates the currency risk. The Group has no hedging arrangements. See Section 2.3.2 "Currency fluctuations could
        affect the Group’s cash flow and financial condition".                    
        However, as the Group's overall financial reporting is presented in NOK, changes in the value of SEK, DKK, EUR, GBP,
        BGN, CHF, RON, MKD or PLN in relation to NOK affect the Group’s overall revenue, profit or loss and financial position.
        Based on exposure throughout the year and balances at the period-end, the Group assesses that fluctuations in
        NOK/EUR, NOK/DKK and NOK/SEK have the most significant impact on the financial reporting of financial assets and
        liabilities.                                                              
        For the year ended 31 December 2019, 80% of the Group’s revenue were generated in a currency other than the NOK.
        Based on exposure throughout the year and balances at the period-end, the Group assesses that fluctuations in
        NOK/EUR, NOK/DKK and NOK/SEK have the most significant impact on the financial reporting of financial assets and
        liabilities.                                                              
        The table below summarises the impact a change in these currencies will have on the consolidated income statement
        and on retained earnings/accumulated losses as of 30 June 2020. The analysis is based on the assumption that the
        foreign exchange rates increase or decrease by 10%, all other variables held constant.

Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        11.4  The Group's 2020 outlook                                            
        11.4.1 Introduction                                                       
        The Group’s future growth will depend on the successful implementation of the Group’s business strategy. The Group’s
        ability to achieve its business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the
        Group’s control. The forecasts included in this Prospectus have been prepared by the Company to give guidance into
        how management views the Group’s expected financial performance for the financial year ending 31 December 2020.
        The profit forecasts has been compiled and prepared on a basis which is both comparable with the historical financial
        information and consistent with the issuers' accounting policies. The outlook statements are forward looking statements
        and carry the risk associated therewith (see Section 4.3 "Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" and
        Section 2.3.4 "The Group's future results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied by the forecast of
        consolidated financial information included in this Prospectus, and investors should not place undue reliance on this
        information").                                                            
        The Group's 2020 outlook included in this Prospectus has been prepared by, and are the sole responsibility of the
        Company's management. PricewaterhouseCoopers AS has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied
        agreed-upon procedures with respect to the Group’s 2020 outlook, and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers AS does
        not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. PricewaterhouseCoopers AS reports included
        in the Prospectus relate solely to the Company's previously issued consolidated financial statements. They do not extend
        to the Group’s 2020 outlook and should not be read to do so.              
        11.4.2 Methodology and assumptions                                        
        The outlook of consolidated financial information for the financial year ending 31 December 2020 has been prepared on
        the basis of the accounting policies set out in note 3 of the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements. The outlook for
        2020 has been prepared for the purpose of this Offering in accordance with the Group's ordinary forecasting procedures
        and on a basis comparable to the historical financial information included elsewhere in this Offering. However, the
        forecast of consolidated financial information is based on a large number of estimates made by the Group based on
        assumptions about future events, which are subject to numerous and significant uncertainties, for example, caused by
        business and/or wider economic risks and uncertainties, which could cause the Company's actual results to differ
        materially from the forecast of financial targets presented herein. Certain of the assumptions, uncertainties and
        contingencies relating to the forecast of consolidated financial information and the projections of consolidated financial
        targets are wholly or partially within the Group's control, while others are outside or substantially outside of its control.
        11.4.3 Key management assumptions that can be influenced by management    
        The Group’s target for reported revenue growth measured in NOK is based on the following key assumptions that can
        be influenced by management: (i) growth from new contracts are estimated on a normalised basis meaning that the
        outlook does not assume revenue streams from single material contracts which have not been signed at the time of
        modelling; and (ii) the Group assumes no M&A transactions in the financial forecast.
        11.4.4 Key management assumptions outside of management’s influence       
        The Group’s target for reported revenue growth measured in NOK is based on the following key assumptions that are
        outside of management’s control: (i) Exchange rate assumptions are based on stable Exchange rates based on average
        rates during the first six months of 2020; (ii) stable macroeconomic situation across the Group's footprint; and (iii) the
        Group assumes low customer concentration and hence no loss of single major contracts that will impact the Group's
        financial performance.                                                    
        11.4.5 Key management assumptions that could materially change the outcome of the forecasts
        The Group’s target for reported revenue growth measured in NOK is based on the following key assumptions that could
        materially change the outcome of the forecasts: (i) growth rates from existing customers are modelled according to
        historical growth rates and amended with expected future trends based on management’s best judgment; (ii) in regards
        to COVID-19, it is assumed that societies remain fairly open and that no material lockdown measures as observed in
        March to June are implemented during second half of 2020 in the Group’s core geographies. Material lockdown measures
        will impact marketing messaging volumes directly; (iii) no material changes to legislation impacting the Group’s ability
        to deliver services efficiently across its regions; and (iv) the Group assumes mobile network operators maintains a
        predictable pricing regime and no material price increases limiting demand for the Group’s services across its customer
        base.                                                                     
        11.4.6 Other key management assumptions                                   
        The Group’s target for reported revenue growth measured in NOK is also based on the following key assumptions: (i)
        existing footprint, no M&A activities included; (ii) revenue growth rates and gross margins are modelled per country and
        summarised on a regional level; (iii) the outlook for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 is based on internal
        management figures up to June 2020 and a forecast for the period from July to December 2020; and (iv) assumptions
        are based on historical trends and run-rate per country and adapted to expected future trends. Expected future trends
        are based on management’s best judgment.                                  
        11.4.7 Key management assumptions per region for revenue and gross margin 
        Nordic region                                                             
        Revenue assumptions: Overall growth rate for the region is assumed to show a moderate decline from 16% in the first
        half of 2020 driven by the extraordinary strong first half results in Norway resulting from additional information
        messaging volumes connected to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sweden experienced a very strong development for second
        half 2019 and management has forecasted lower growth rates in second half 2020, compared to the underlying growth
        in the first half of 2020. In Denmark and Finland, management expects pick-up in growth rates driven by softer
                                        64

Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        comparable in the second half of 2019 for Denmark, while Finland had a soft start to 2020 and management has assumed
        a pick-up in growth rates late in 2020.                                   
                                                                                  
        Gross Margin assumptions: Management assumes fairly stable margins overall for the full year in the region with normal
        seasonality with lower margins in the fourth quarter of 2020, as a higher portion of the volume derives from high volume
        but lower margin customers due to campaigns in connection with the Christmas season. Management assumes Gross
        Margin to be slightly reduced for the year ending 31 December 2020 as a result of customer mix as high volume but
        lower margin customers constituting a larger portion of the growth in volumes and thereby diluting margins slightly. The
        negative effect on gross margin from customer mix outweighs the increased margins from positive product mix.
        Central region                                                            
        Revenue assumptions: Overall growth rates for the region are assumed to decrease in the second half compared to first
        half of 2020 as the acquisition of the TeraComm Group in August 2019 becomes part of the organic footprint while
        underlying business excluding acquisitions is expected to maintain a stable growth rate in line with the year ended
        31 December 2019. The revenue momentum in Germany is strongly linked to industries like logistics and e-commerce
        which experience a volume increase from COVID-19. Management also expects a rebound in messaging volumes and
        activity in markets like Bulgaria, Romania and Poland although recovery has been slower than for the Western Europe
        region. Management has forecasted lower mobile payments revenue in Bulgaria and Romania for the remaining months
        in 2020 due to COVID-19. Due to the revenue streams in Bulgaria and Romania, lower gross margin will have limited
        impact on Group’s profitability.                                          
        Gross Margin assumptions: Management assumes gross margin will remain stable compared to the financial year ended
        31 December 2019 based on current trends. Stabilisation of Germany’s gross margin through the second quarter 2020
        has been key to set an assumption of stable margin development.           
        Western region                                                            
        Revenues assumptions: Overall growth rate for the region is assumed to decline from the 21% level in the first half of
        2020 as Spot-Hit becomes part of the organic footprint. The outlook assumes continued fairly open societies in countries
        which were mostly impacted by severe lockdown measures during the first half of 2020 (Italy, France and Spain). The
        assumed growth rates for second half of 2020 are in line with reported growth rates before COVID-19 negatively
        impacted growth rates from April.                                         
        Gross Margin assumptions: Overall management assumes stable margin development in the region with a margin decline
        in entities like Netmessage and Spot Hit from customer mix and quality measures. In entities like Spain and Netsize
        management has assumed expanded margins from healthier customer and country mix and new products.
        Global messaging                                                          
        Revenue assumptions: Growth rates on global messaging are assumed to decline in the second half of 2020 primarily
        due to lower aggregator revenue. The Group observes that volume thresholds that enable discounts from the mobile
        operators on certain destinations will be met to a larger extent compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019
        by enterprise traffic, thus resulting in reduced aggregator volumes. The reduction on aggregator volumes will have close
        to zero impact on gross margin, as the profitability is very low for the relevant destinations. The Group expects to
        continue to experience healthy growth in their Global Enterprises business through expansion of their business to new
        destinations for P2A messaging volumes. Growth rates can be volatile in global messaging while gross margin sensitivity
        is limited due to the lower margin level, especially for aggregator customers.
        Gross Margin assumptions: Gross margin is assumed to slightly decline for the year ending 31 December 2020 compared
        to the financial year ended 31 December 2019. The decline is mainly driven by the highly competitive aggregator
        landscape with competition pushing traffic at a loss margin, especially during the second quarter of 2020. As the Group
        moves away from the most competitive routes, management expects Gross Margins to improve during the second half
        of 2020.

        The Group’s total revenue for the year ending 31 December 2020 is forecasted to be in the range of NOK 3,500 – 3,600
        million.

        The Group’s total Gross Margin for the year ending 31 December 2020 is forecasted in the range 24.2% – 24.7% of total
        revenues.                                                                 
        Adjusted EBITDA6                                                          
        For the year ending 31 December 2020, the Group forecasts the Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of NOK 360 million
        – NOK 370 million.                                                        
        6 For the purpose of this Section 11.4.8, Adjusted EBITDA is derived from operating profit (loss) and defined as operating profit (loss)
        added back depreciation and amortization and adjusted for M&A activities costs and restructuring costs and other. M&A activities costs
        are mainly related to consultant and legal advisors expenses incurred in connection with acquisition of subsidiaries. Restructuring costs
        and other are mainly related to (i) efficiency projects, start-up costs for new businesses and branding/rebranding costs in connection with
        the acquisition of subsidiaries and (ii) severance paid to certain employees as a result of acquisition of subsidiaries and changes in the
        Group’s strategic focus also including certain replacement/rehiring cost. See also Section 4.2.3 "Non-IFRS financial measures".

Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        11.4.9 Capital expenditures                                               
        For the year ending 31 December 2020, the Group forecasts capital expenditure levels at NOK 95 million – NOK 105
        million as the Group continues to invest in CPaaS innovation and LINK Suite capabilities which will differentiate the
        business in the long-term.                                                
        11.4.10 Medium-to-long term outlook                                       
        From 2017 to 2019, the Company recorded a 51% CAGR in revenue driven by both organic growth and M&A activity.
        The Company is targeting continued strong revenue growth in the medium-to-long term, fuelled by increased customer
        and market penetration, investments in go-to market initialise, continued expansion of the CPaaS platform and M&A
        strategy. If such sustained growth is achieved, the Company will realize its medium-to-long term revenue target of
        NOK 10 billion. In addition, the Company intends to achieve incremental growth in Gross Margins due to increased
        revenue mix of higher value-add solutions and software, partially offset by growing mix of Western and Central European
        revenues.                                                                 
        From 2017 to 2019, the Company recorded a 55% CAGR in EBITDA. The Company is targeting continued strong EBITDA
        growth in the medium-to-long term, with growth investments in the CPaaS platform and GTM initiatives expected to
        drive a slight decline in EBITDA Margin. In the longer term, the Company is targeting net debt to Adjusted EBITDA below
        3.0x. Capital expenditure levels are targeted to stay between NOK 100 million and NOK 125 million, as the Company
        continues to invest in CPaaS innovation and LINK Suite capabilities which will differentiate the business in the long-term.
        No other initiatives currently planned suggest that capital expenditure will exceed the projected amounts upon
        completion of LINK Suite investments.                                     
        11.5  Recent development                                                  
        During 2020, the Company has seen a growth in services rendered to existing customers as well as adding new customers
        to its portfolio as further described in Section 8.8 "Customers". In addition, the Group has fully integrated companies
        acquired in 2019, which have further expanded the Group's presence in the market. Please refer to Section 11.14.3
        "Acquisitions". For a further description of the recent trends reference is made to note 9 in the Condensed Interim
        Financial Statements.                                                     
        On 15 September 2020, the Company adopted 1:20 share split that reduces the nominal value per share from NOK 0.10
        to NOK 0.005 with the Company's shareholders being allocated 19 new shares for each share they own as of the
        resolution. Following such resolution, the share capital of the Company was NOK 1,082,289.50 divided on 216,457,900
        shares, each with a nominal value of NOK 0.005 and of which 213,874,740 are ordinary shares, and 2,583,160 are
        preference shares, see Section 13.3 "Share capital and share capital history". For adjustments for significant transactions
        between 30 June 2020 to the date of the Prospectus, not subject to the Offering and Listing, see Section 11.5 "Recent
        development".                                                             
        On 15 September 2020, the Company's general meeting resolved a share capital increase of 324,000 new shares directed
        towards LINK ESOT. For more information about LINK ESOT and the share capital increase, see Section 12.6.4
        "Participation of the employees in the Company’s share capital" and Section 13.3 "Share capital and share capital
        history".                                                                 
        Further, on 24 September 2020, the Company’s general meeting resolved to redeem the Company’s class of preference
        shares, resulting in a share capital decrease of NOK 12,915.80 and the Company having a share capital of
        NOK 1,070,993.70, divided on 214.198.740 Shares and the Company only having one class of ordinary shares. The
        share capital decrease was registered with the Norwegian Register of Enterprises on 2 October 2020, see Section 13.3
        "Share capital and share capital history".                                
        Apart from the above, from 30 June 2020 up to the date of this Prospectus, there have been no significant changes in
        the Group's financial and trading position. To the best of the Company's knowledge, there are no trends, uncertainties,
        demands, commitments or events that will have a material effect on the Group’s business during the current financial
        period.

         3 Central Europe includes Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and North Macedonia.

         5 Global Messaging includes the main share of aggregator business and the Swiss entity also holding global enterprise customers.
        Revenue was NOK 1.7 billion for the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to NOK 1.3 billion for the six months
        ended 30 June 2019. This increase was primarily as a result of organic growth and acquisitions during the year 2019.
        The organic growth was driven by the expansion of the Group’s customer base and stable revenue intake from the
        existing customers as well as the full integration of Netsize in the Group’s business structure following its acquisition in
        January 2019. During this period, the Group also increased the price of its products and solutions, further contributing
        to revenue growth. This growth is also partly as a result of the introduction of new products such as Verified SMS and
        LINK Live Chat during the six months ended 30 June 2020. Furthermore, the fluctuations in NOK/EUR, NOK/SEK and
        NOK/DKK exchange rates have also influenced the revenue growth, "General information - Presentation of financial and
        other information - Exchange rates". This growth in revenue was partially offset by lower revenues in Spain and the
        negative impact of lower volumes in the second quarter of 2020 due to COVID-19.
        In the Nordics, the revenue was NOK 545.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to NOK 468.4
        million for the six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 16.4%. The increase was primarily driven by higher usage
        from the existing customers as well as the price increase in the region.  
        In Central Europe, the revenue was NOK 374.2 million for the three months ended 30 June 2020 compared to
        NOK 272.3 million for the three months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 37.4%. The increase was primarily driven
        by the acquisition of Teracomm Group in Bulgaria (see Section 11.14.3 "Acquisitions") and an increase in volumes due
        to COVID-19.                                                              
        In Western Europe, the revenue was NOK 534.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to NOK 441.9
        million for the six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 20.9%. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition
        of Spot.it in Italy (see Section 11.14.3 "Acquisitions".                  
        In Global Messaging segment, the revenue was NOK 264.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to
        NOK 153.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 71.9%. The growth was primarily driven by
        high volumes in the aggregator business and growth of password verification services provided to the Group’s global
        customers.                                                                
        11.7.2 Direct cost of services rendered                                   
        Direct cost of services rendered was NOK 1,288.3 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020, compared to
        NOK 980.8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 31.4%. This increase was primarily as a result
        of volume increase and acquisitions that have been operationally consolidated within the Group. Namely, the growth in
        the number of customers both organically and through acquisitions has resulted in an increase of the cost of services
        rendered.

        11.8.7 Operating profit (loss)                                            
        Primarily as a result of the factors described above, the Group's operating loss for the year ended 31 December 2019
        was NOK 37.0 million, compared to a operating profit of NOK 29.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 with
        Gross Margin of 26% and 28% for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018. The lower Gross Margin is as a result
        of the changes in customer mix, with high volume customers, which pay a lower per message price, representing a
        higher percentage of the customer base. For the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, Gross Margin for the Nordics
        was 32% and 33%, respectively; for Central Europe was 26% and 26%, respectively; for Western Europe was 24%
        and 30%, respectively; and for Global Messaging was 11% and 13%, respectively.

        Finance income was NOK 22.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared to NOK 15.0 million for the year
        ended 31 December 2018, an increase of 46.6%. This increase was primarily as a result of increase in foreign exchange
        gains. The increase in other financial income was mainly due to the reversal of a credit from the year ended 31 December
        2018. For a discussion on the limitations on the comparability of these results, see Section 4.2.2 "Factors affecting
        comparability of results".

        year ended 31 December 2018, an increase of 44.5%. This increase was primarily related to increase on interest
        expenses, amortised costs and losses on foreign exchange primarily related to the Senior Facilities Agreements (see
        Section 4.2.2 "Factors affecting comparability of results"). Further and during the year ended 31 December 2018, Link
        Mobility Group AS incurred an expense of NOK 69,606 thousand related to early settlement of its bond loan, as well as
        an expense of NOK 20,732 thousand related to adjustments on the purchase price of previously acquired subsidiary.
        11.8.10 Total finance income (expense)                                    
        Primarily as a result of the factors described above, the Group’s finance expense for the year ended 31 December 2019
        was NOK 193.9 million, compared to finance expense of NOK 134.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, an
        increase of 44.3%. For a discussion on the limitations on the comparability of these results, see Section 4.2.2 "Factors
        affecting comparability of results".

        Total income tax was NOK 2.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared to NOK 23.4 million for the year
        ended 31 December 2018, a decrease of 109.3%. This decrease in income tax was mainly due to increase in deferred
        tax expense in 2018. For a discussion on the limitations on the comparability of these results, see Section 4.2.2 "Factors
        affecting comparability of results".

        Revenue was NOK 1,972.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 compared to NOK 1,294.0 million for the
        year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 52.4%. This increase was primarily as a result of organic
        growth and acquisitions during the year 2018. The organic growth was driven by the expansion of the Group’s
        customer base and stable revenue intake from the existing customers and the integration of the Global Messaging
        segment, which was acquired in 2018, to the Group’s operations. This growth is also partly as a result of the
        introduction of new products such as Link Conversations, Link Data Insight and RCS in 2018. The revenue growth in
        the year ended 30 December 2018 was partially offset by costs and lower volumes related to GDPR
        compliance and data protection related adjustments.                       
        For the year ended 31 December 2018, Like-for-Like Revenue was NOK 1.4 billion (equal to 72.3% of the revenue for
        such period) compared to NOK 810.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 (equal to 62.6% of the revenue for
        such period) See 4.2.3 "General information - Presentation of financial and other information - Non-IFRS financial
        measures".                                                                
        In the Nordics, the revenue was NOK 915.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 compared to NOK 802.3 million
        for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 14.1%. The increase was primarily driven by expansion of the
        customer base and stable revenue intake from the existing customers.      
        In Central Europe, the revenue was NOK 515.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 compared to NOK 345.1
        million for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 49.33%. The increase was primarily driven by the

        11.9.7 Operating profit (loss)                                            
        Primarily as a result of the factors described above, the Group's operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2018
        was NOK 29.8 million, compared to NOK 45.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2017, a decrease of 34.1%. This
        was primarily a result of the Group recording a Gross Margin of 28% and 31% for the years ended 31 December 2018
        and 2017. The lower Gross Margin is as a result of the changes in customer mix, with high volume customers, which
        pay a lower per message price, representing a higher percentage of the customer base. For the years ended 31 December
        2018 and 2017 Gross Margin for the Nordics was 33% and 36%, respectively; for Central Europe was 26% and 22%,
        respectively; for Western Europe was 30% and 20%, respectively; and for Global Messaging was 13% and not applicable
        (as it became an operating segment in 2018), respectively.

        ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 73.9%. This increase was primarily as a result of increase in foreign exchange
        gains, partially offset by a decrease in other financial income mainly due to minor decreases in interest income from
        bank deposits.

        Finance expense was NOK 149.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, compared to NOK 54.9 million for the
        year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 172.2%. This increase was primarily as a result of an increase in premium
        early settlement and expensed transaction cost in connection with the early repayment of financing arrangements in
        connection with the Group’s acquisition by LINK Pecunia. These costs also took effect in 2019.
        11.9.10 Total finance income (expense)                                    
        Primarily as a result of the factors described in Sections 11.7.8 "Finance income" and 11.7.9 "Finance expenses" above,
        the Group’s net finance expense for the year ended 31 December 2018 was NOK 134.4 million, compared to an expense
        of NOK 46.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 190.5%.
        11.9.11 Income tax                                                        
        Total income tax was NOK 23.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, compared to negative NOK 4.3 million
        for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 643.5%. The increase in income tax was mainly due to the increase
        in deferred tax in 2018.

        As a result of the factors described above, the Group’s loss for the year ended 31 December 2018 was NOK 81.3 million,
        compared to a loss of NOK 5.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 1,418.7%.
        11.10 Non-IFRS financial measures and other key performance indicators    
        In assessing the performance of the Group’s business, it considers a variety of financial and operating metrics, including
        certain financial measures which are not measures of financial performance under IFRS, as adopted by the European
        Union. Such measures may not be indicative of historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive
        of future results. The Group has presented these non-IFRS measures in this Prospectus because it considers them an
        important supplemental measure of its performance and believes that they are widely used by investors in comparing
        performance between companies.

Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
         5 The following table reconciles Like-for-Like Revenue to revenue for the relevant periods:
                                                   Six months ended Year ended    
                                                     30 June     31 December      
           (In NOK million)

           Revenue .................................................................................................................. 1,717.6 1,336.1 2,932.7 1,972.0 1,294.0
           Acquisition Revenue(a) ............................................................................................... -104.0 -370.8 -803.9 -584.1 -38.6
           Like-for-Like Revenue(b) ............................................................................................. 1,613.6 965.3 2,128.7 1,387.9 1,255.4
            (a) Acquisition Revenue is defined as revenue generated by the acquired entities for the periods indicated. The Company considers Acquisition
                Revenue any revenue generated by acquired entities for four full consecutive quarters after complete ownership by the Company of such
                entity. From 1 January 2018 an acquired Spanish entity was merged with an existing entity, hence the allocation of revenues between organic
                and acquired revenue is based on a management estimate. In 2017 an acquired Danish entity was merged with an existing Danish entity,
                hence the allocation between organic and acquired revenue is estimated. See Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions".
            (b) When comparing the Like-for-Like Revenue for a relevant period, the entities used for such calculation differ from period to period, as the
                Company excludes revenues from companies acquired during the relevant periods in calculating Like-for-Like Revenue. This methodology
                allows the Company to isolate and compare the revenue generated by the companies that were operating for the full relevant period compared.
                See Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions".                                
                When comparing the years ended 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2019, the Company excludes revenues from companies acquired in
                2019 and 2018, but includes the revenue from companies acquired in 2017, as the Company no longer considers such revenue as Acquisition
                Revenue. The growth rate of Like-for-Like Revenue for the years ended 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2019 increased from 1,956.9 to
                2,128.7, an increase of 9%.                                       
                When comparing the years ended 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2018, the Company excludes revenues from companies acquired in
                2017 and 2018. The growth rate of Like-for-Like Revenue for the years ended 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2018 increased from
                1,255.4 to 1,387.9, an increase of 11%.                           
         6 Gross Profit Conversion is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Gross Profit.
         7 Revenue Net Retention Rate is defined as revenue from the net of upsale, downsale and churn for customers throughout the period, not taking into
           account new customers during the year. Revenue Net Retention Rate excludes the acquisitions of TeraComm Group and Spothit. Excluding Spain, these
           figures are 116% and 111% for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and as of 31 December 2020, respectively. The data required to calculate these
           measures was not yet monitored in the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 and as a result comparatives for the years ended 31 December 2017
           and 2018 are not available.                                            
         8 Churn Rate is defined as revenue of customers that were a customer in the prior period but were not a customer at the beginning of the current period
           divided by the total revenue of the prior period. The data required to calculate these measures was not yet monitored in the years ended 31 December
           2017 and 2018 and as a result comparatives for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 are not available.
         9 Net Customer Expansion Rate is defined as the revenue generated from customers at the end of the period with their corresponding revenue from the
           same period in the previous year.                                      
        11.11 Liquidity and capital resources                                     
              1Introduction                                                       
        The Group manages its financing structure and cash flow requirements in response to the Group’s strategy and
        objectives, deploying financial and other resources related to those objectives.
        As of the date of this Prospectus, the Group has available cash resources amounting to approximately NOK 515 million.
        The Group currently has undrawn credit facilities in an amount of NOK 9 million. The Group holds cash in in the following
        currencies: BGN, CHF, DKK, EUR, GBP, HUF, MKD, NOK, PLN, RON, SEK and USD.
        The Group’s liquidity requirements arise primarily from the need to fund working capital and capital expenditures for the
        expansion, maintenance and refurbishment of the Group’s information technology and other assets, as well as to make
        acquisitions and realise potential growth and cost-saving opportunities from acquisitions and related synergies.
        The Group's main source of liquidity are primarily through financing arrangements, revenues from operating activities
        and cash and cash equivalents.                                            
        The Group may also dispose of non-core businesses or enter into joint ventures or other partnerships that would generate
        cash. The Group’s future financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, many of which are not foreseeable.
        The Group assesses capital on the basis of a leverage ratio as shown in the table below on an as adjusted basis as of
        the date of the Prospectus (prior to Adjustments subject to the Offering and Listing). Please also refer to Section 9
        "Capitalisation and indebtedness".

Risks                                                                   
          The Group has identified three types of risks that can prevent successful implementation of its
          business strategy or manage its growth effectively: market risk, financial risk, and acquisition risk.
                                                                                  
          The below section describes how the Group evaluates and mitigates these risks and includes a
          brief comment to the risk related to the Covid-19 virus.                
                                                                                  
          Market risk                                                             
          LINK’s market share for A2P mobile services have grown rapidly over time through both organic
          growth and through acquisitions and benefits from a unique competitive position. LINK is by far
          the largest player in Europe within its industry resulting in economies of scale relating to capacity
          and competences for developing and launching new products, broad existing product offerings
          and solid expertise in operations and system integrations towards customers.
                                                                                  
          Based on market and competitive advantages, LINK builds long-term customer relationships
                                                                                  
          through high quality of services, system integration and development of new products and
          solutions. LINK has very low customer churn in all markets as customers who have first started
          using mobile communications in one area, tend to move more and more business activities to
          mobile platforms increasing integration and reliability on LINK.        
                                                                                  
          LINK’s revenue, costs and profits are subjected to the risk of changes in customer prices. As the
          market is expanding, margin pressure is observed and anticipated in some parts of the market.
          The price pressure is likely to be focused on low-value wholesale/bulk SMS and basic mobile
          payment services. LINK will therefore continue its strategy of delivering value added services to
          its customers through new innovative solutions such as conversational messaging and channel
          agnostic solutions improving the mobile messaging use case. LINK’s broad specter of mobile
          services enables a customer offering that is complete and covering multiple needs. This creates
          high customer satisfaction and creates close relationships between LINK and its customers. As
          the use case expands, LINK address smaller and medium sized customers which typically have a
          higher price point per message. These factors reduce the overall price risk. Expanding towards a
                                                                                  
          channel-agnostic messaging solution will contribute to reducing message delivery cost by utilizing
          more IP based protocols and hence improving and protecting gross margin.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Financial risk                                                          
          The Group’s activities expose it to financial risks, such as price, currency, liquidity, interest rate
