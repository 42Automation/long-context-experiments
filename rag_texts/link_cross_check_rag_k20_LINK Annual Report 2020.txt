         The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
         Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the
         European Union. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
                                                                                  
         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting
         estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgments in applying the Group’s accounting policies. Areas
         involving a high degree of judgment or complexity, and areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant to
         the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 4 (critical accounting judgements and key sources of
         estimation variances). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis.
         The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statement is Norwegian kroner (NOK), which is also the
         functional currency of the parent company.                               
                                                                                  
         3.3 Principles of consolidation                                          
         The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries,
         which are entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when the Group has power over the investee, is
         exposed, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power
         to affect its returns. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate
         that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control noted above. The financial statements of the
         subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting periods as the parent company and consistent accounting policies
         are applied. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement
         from the date when control is obtained and until control ceases, respectively. Intercompany transactions, balances,
         revenues, expenses and unrealised Group internal gains or losses are eliminated on consolidation.
         When the group ceases to consolidate an investee because of a loss of control, any retained interest in the entity is
         remeasured to its fair value with the change in the carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value of the
         retained interest becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the investment.
                                                                                  
         3.4 Business combinations                                                
         Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred and all the
         identifiable assets and liabilities of acquired entities are measured at fair values at the date of acquisition, except
         deferred tax assets or liabilities and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements, which are
         recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively.
         Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

         Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less
         accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis
         over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each
         reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible
         assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
         Separately acquired intangible assets                                    
         Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation
         and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent to initial recognition, separately acquired intangible assets are
         reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible
         assets that are acquired in a business combination.                      
                                                                                  
         Internally generated intangible assets – technology                      
         Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally-
         generated intangible asset arising from development of the Groups technical platforms and products is recognised if,
         and only if, all the following conditions have been demonstrated:        
         y the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
         y the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;     
                                                                                  
         y the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;                       
         y how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
         y the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell
          the intangible asset; and                                               
         y the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
         The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from
         the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally generated
         intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is
         incurred.                                                                
                                                                                  
         Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated
         amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired in a
         business combination.                                                    
         3.8 Equipment and fixtures                                               
         Equipment and fixtures are initially recognised at cost, which includes the purchase price (including duties and non-
         refundable purchase taxes) and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition
         necessary for it to be able to operate in the intended manner. Equipment and fixtures are subsequently recognised at
         cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is recognised so as to
         reduce the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method. Depreciation
         commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.              
                                                                                  
         Estimated useful life, depreciation method and residual values are reviewed at least annually. The straight-line
         depreciation method is used as this best reflects the consumption of the assets, which often is the passage of time.
         Residual value is estimated to be zero for all assets.                   
                                                                                  
         Repair and maintenance is expensed as incurred. If new parts are capitalised, replaced parts are derecognised and
         any remaining net carrying amount is recognised in operating profit (loss) as loss on disposal.
         An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are

Significant input used in the estimation of fair values utilising the above methods are as follows:
                                                                                  
         y The remaining estimated useful life of customer relationships is between 7 and 10 years
         y The remaining estimated useful life of technology is 10 years          
         y Revenue growth and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins are based on
          estimates of growth and margins in the respective companies             
                                                                                  
         Estimated impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets             
         The carrying amounts of non-current tangible and intangible assets are assessed by means of impairment tests
         whenever there is an indication of impairment. Any impairment of goodwill is assessed at least annually. The
         recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These
         calculations require management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit
         and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. As of 31 December 2020, the amount of goodwill
         tested for impairment amounted to KNOK 3 982 843 (FY2019 - KNOK 3 389 875). No impairment losses were
         recognised in FY2020 (FY2019 - nil). Please refer to notes 3 (summary of significant accounting policies) and 12
         (intangible assets) for further details related to the impairment testing methodology and results.
                                                                                  
         Deferred tax assets                                                      
         Management judgment is required in determining provisions for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities
         and the extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized. The Group is also subject to income taxes in various
         jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the Group’s provision for income taxes. There may be transactions
         and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where
         the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will
         impact the income tax and deferred tax liability and expense in the period in which such determination is made.
                                                                                  
         Purchase price of subsidiaries – earn-out                                
         Periodically, the Group acquires subsidiaries where the preliminary purchase price is based on an assumption that
         the acquired company will achieve a target EBITDA for the current financial year. The final purchase price is subject
         to an upwards or downwards earn-out adjustment based on the company’s actual achieved EBITDA. The earn-out
         adjustment is accounted for in the income statement as finance income or expense.

         On 15 April 2020, LINK Mobility Group Holding ASA entered into a definitive agreement for the acquisition of

         developed an omnichannel marketing platform with an integrated customer data platform (CDP) giving customers a
         unified profile view.

         The financial information in this report is prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as
         adopted by the EU. To enhance the understanding of LINK’s performance, the Group presents several alternative
         performance measures (“APM’s”). An APM is defined by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)
         guidelines as a financial measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other
         than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework (IFRS).
                                                                                  
         See below for a reconciliation of EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin.
         Below, LINK presents certain APMs, including gross margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin.
         APMs such as EBITDA are commonly reported by companies in the markets in which LINK competes and are widely
         used by investors when comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to factors such as depreciation
         and amortization, which can vary significantly, depending upon accounting methods (particularly when acquisitions
         have occurred) or based on non-operating factors.

LINK uses the following APMs:                                            
                                                                                  
         Gross Profit                                                             
         Gross Profit means revenues less direct costs of services rendered.      
                                                                                  
         Gross margin                                                             
         Gross margin means gross profit as a percentage of total operating revenues.
                                                                                  
         Adjusted EBITDA                                                          
         Adjusted EBITDA means EBITDA adjusted by expenses related to significant one-time, non-recurring events such as
         acquisitions and restructuring activities, legal advisors, and share-based compensation. LINK has presented adjusted
         EBITDA in the consolidated statement of profit and loss because management believes the measure provides useful
         information regarding operating performance.                             
                                                                                  
         Adjusted EBITDA margin                                                   
         Adjusted EBITDA margin is presented as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total operating
         revenues in the respective periods.                                      
                                                                                  
         EBITDA                                                                   
         EBITDA means earnings before interest, taxes, amortization, depreciation, and impairments. LINK has presented
         EBITDA in the consolidated statement of profit and loss because management believes that the measure provides
         useful information regarding the Group’s ability to service debt and to fund capital expenditures and provides a
         helpful measure for comparing its operating performance with that of other companies.

         3.3 Principles of consolidation                                          
         The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries,
         which are entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when the Group has power over the investee, is
         exposed, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power
         to affect its returns. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate
         that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control noted above. The financial statements of the
         subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting periods as the parent company and consistent accounting policies
         are applied. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement
         from the date when control is obtained and until control ceases, respectively. Intercompany transactions, balances,
         revenues, expenses and unrealised Group internal gains or losses are eliminated on consolidation.
                                                                                  
         When the group ceases to consolidate an investee because of a loss of control, any retained interest in the entity is
         remeasured to its fair value with the change in the carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value of the
         retained interest becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the investment.
                                                                                  
         3.4 Business combinations                                                
         Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred and all the
         identifiable assets and liabilities of acquired entities are measured at fair values at the date of acquisition, except
         deferred tax assets or liabilities and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements, which are
         recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively.
         Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.  
                                                                                  
         Goodwill is measured at the amount by which the total consideration transferred exceeds the net fair value of assets
         acquired. Goodwill is not amortised, but its value is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when
         there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, may be impaired. Goodwill
         is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash generating units) that is expected to
         benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its
         carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any
         impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not
         reversed in subsequent periods.                                          
                                                                                  
         When the consideration transferred by the Company in a business combination includes contingent consideration
         arrangements, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of
         the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that
         qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments recognised
         in goodwill. Measurement period adjustments arise from additional information obtained during the ‘measurement
         period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the
         acquisition date. The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not
         qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent
         consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent
         settlement is accounted for within equity. Other contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at subsequent
         reporting dates with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.

I f the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the
         combination occurs, the Company reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
         Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see above), or additional assets or
         liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the
         acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
                                                                                  
         On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination
         of the profit or loss on disposal.                                       
                                                                                  
         3.5 Revenue recognition                                                  
         Revenues are recognised when services are rendered and measured based on the consideration to which the
         Company expects to be entitled in a contract with a customer net of discounts and sales related taxes. The
         Company recognises revenue when it transfers control of a product or service to a customer.
                                                                                  
         In order to determine whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent, the Company assesses whether
         the Company controls the service before it is provided to the customer. Where the Company does not control the
         service, the Company is considered an agent in the transaction.          
                                                                                  
         Revenues primarily comprise sale of services that enable customers to communicate by mobile phone with their
         customers. In order to be able to render these services, the Company needs to obtain services from one or more
         telecommunication operators.                                             
                                                                                  
         The services rendered are split into the following groups:

         3.6 Foreign currency translation                                         
         In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s
         functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
         transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are
         retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in
         foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary
         items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated after the transaction
         date.                                                                    
                                                                                  
         Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the
         income statement as financial items. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented on a net basis in the
         income statement as other operating expenses. Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in
         which they arise.                                                        
                                                                                  
         For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company’s
         foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are
         translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that
         period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are
         recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity.
                                                                                  
         Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are considered as assets and
         liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. These exchange differences are recognised in other
         comprehensive income.                                                    
                                                                                  
         On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Company’s entire interest in a foreign operation), or a
         disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, all of the exchange differences
         accumulated in a separate component of equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the
         company are reclassified to profit or loss. In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes
         a foreign operation that does not result in the Company losing control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share
         of accumulated exchange differences is re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in profit or
         loss.

         3.8 Equipment and fixtures                                               
         Equipment and fixtures are initially recognised at cost, which includes the purchase price (including duties and non-
         refundable purchase taxes) and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition
         necessary for it to be able to operate in the intended manner. Equipment and fixtures are subsequently recognised at
         cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is recognised so as to
         reduce the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method. Depreciation
         commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.              
         Estimated useful life, depreciation method and residual values are reviewed at least annually. The straight-line
         depreciation method is used as this best reflects the consumption of the assets, which often is the passage of time.
         Residual value is estimated to be zero for all assets.                   
                                                                                  
         Repair and maintenance is expensed as incurred. If new parts are capitalised, replaced parts are derecognised and
         any remaining net carrying amount is recognised in operating profit (loss) as loss on disposal.
                                                                                  
         An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
         expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an
         item of equipment and fixtures is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount
         of the asset and is presented as other income or other expenses in the income statement.
         3.9 Impairment of non-financial assets                                   
         At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible
         assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
         indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if
         any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Company estimates
         the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent
         basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or
         otherwise they are allocated to the smallest Company of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent
         allocation basis can be identified.                                      
         Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever
         there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.                   
                                                                                  
         Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
         estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
         market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future
         cash flows have not been adjusted.                                       
                                                                                  
         If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
         carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
         recognised immediately in profit or loss.                                
                                                                                  
         Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is
         increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not
         exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset
         (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss,
         unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated
         as a revaluation increase. Any impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

         estimation variances                                                     
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
         In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, as described in note 3 (summary of significant accounting
         policies), management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
         of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are
         based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are considered to be
         relevant. Future events may cause these estimates to change and actual results may differ from these estimates.
         Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.   
                                                                                  
         Changes in accounting estimates are recognised in the period when the changes occurred, if they apply to that
         period. If the changes also apply to future periods, the effect will be distributed between the current period and future
         periods.                                                                 
                                                                                  
         Business combinations                                                    
         The Company has finalised certain acquisitions in FY2020; refer to note 5 (business combinations) for further
         details. In order to account for the business combinations and determine the fair value of the underlying assets and
         liabilities in accordance with IFRS 3, management has used significant judgement. In order to calculate the fair
         value of the intangible assets in the acquired companies, the expected future cash flows have been reconciled to
         the purchase price of the acquired companies. The reconciliation is performed via a Business Enterprise Valuation
         (BEV). Intangible assets have been valued using the Multi Excess Earnings Method (“MEEM”) and Relief From Royalty
         Method (“RFR”). The methods are considered to be appropriate for the type of assets being valued (MEEM for
         customer relationships and RFR for technology and trade name). The excess of the consideration over the fair value
         of the net identifiable assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.       
                                                                                  
         Significant input used in the estimation of fair values utilising the above methods are as follows:
         y The remaining estimated useful life of customer relationships is between 7 and 10 years
         y The remaining estimated useful life of technology is 10 years          
         y Revenue growth and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins are based on
          estimates of growth and margins in the respective companies             
                                                                                  
         Estimated impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets             
         The carrying amounts of non-current tangible and intangible assets are assessed by means of impairment tests
         whenever there is an indication of impairment. Any impairment of goodwill is assessed at least annually. The
         recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These
         calculations require management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit
         and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. As of 31 December 2020, the amount of goodwill
         tested for impairment amounted to KNOK 3 982 843
