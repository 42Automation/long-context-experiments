Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        4.2.3 Non-IFRS financial measures                                         
        In this Prospectus, the Group presents certain alternative performance measures ("APMs"), including Churn Rate, Gross
        Profit, Gross Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Profit Conversion,
        Revenue Net Retention Rate and Like-for-Like Revenue. The APMs presented herein are not measurements of financial
        performance or liquidity under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, are not audited and investors
        should not consider any such measures to be an alternative to (a) operating revenues or operating profit (as determined
        in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), (b) as a measure of the Group's operating performance;
        or (c) any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. The APMs presented herein
        may not be indicative of the Group's historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of the
        Group's future results.                                                   
        The Group believes that APMs are commonly reported by companies in the markets in which it competes and are widely
        used by investors in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to factors such as depreciation and
        amortisation, which can vary significantly, depending upon accounting methods (particularly when acquisitions have
        occurred) or based on non-operating factors. Accordingly, the Group discloses Churn Rate, Gross Profit, Gross Margin,
        EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Profit Conversion, Revenue Net
        Retention Rate and Like-for-Like Revenue herein to permit a more complete and comprehensive analysis of its underlying
        operating performance relative to other companies and across periods, and of the Group's ability to service its debt.
        Because companies may calculate Churn Rate, Gross Profit, Gross Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
        Margin, LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Profit Conversion, Revenue Net Retention Rate and Like-for-Like Revenue
        differently, the Group's presentation of these APMs may not be comparable to similar titled measures used by other
        companies.                                                                
        The Group defines "Churn Rate" as revenue of customers that were a customer in the prior period but were not a
        customer at the beginning of the current period divided by the total revenue of the prior period.
        The group defines "Gross Profit" as revenue less direct costs of services rendered.
        The Group defines "Gross Margin" as revenue less direct costs divided by revenue.
        The Group defines "EBITDA" as operating profit (loss) adding back depreciation and amortisation.
        The Group defines "Adjusted EBITDA" as EBITDA adjusted for mergers and acquisitions costs, restructuring costs and
        costs related to share option program.                                    
        The Group defines "Adjusted EBITDA Margin" as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of operating revenues in the
        respective periods.                                                       
        The Group defines "Like-for-Like Revenue" as revenue recorded in an audited or reviewed period excluding the
        revenue from acquired entities in such period.                            
        The Group defined "LTM Adjusted EBITDA" as Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months from the end of the period
        The Group defines "Gross Profit Conversion" as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Gross Profit.
        The Group defines "Net Customer Expansion Rate" as the revenue generated from customers at the end of the period
        with their corresponding revenue from the same period in the previous year.
        The Group defines "Revenue Net Retention Rate" as revenue from the net of upsale, downsale and churn for
        customers throughout the period, not taking into account new customers during the period. Revenue Net Retention Rate
        excludes the acquisitions of TeraComm Group and Spothit.                  
        For an overview of reconciliation and calculation of the relevant APMs, please see Section 10.7 "Non-IFRS financial
        measures".                                                                
        4.2.4 Industry and market data                                            
        This Prospectus contains statistics, data, statements and other information relating to markets, market sizes, market
        shares, market positions and other industry data pertaining to the Group’s business and the industries and markets in
        which it operates. Unless otherwise indicated, such information reflects the Group’s estimates based on analysis of
        multiple sources, including data compiled by professional organisations, consultants and analysts and information

        presentations published by listed companies operating within the same industry as the Group, as well as the Group’s
        internal data and its own experience, or on a combination of the foregoing. Unless otherwise indicated in the Prospectus,
        the basis for any statements regarding the Group’s competitive position is based on the Company’s own assessment and
        knowledge of the market in which it operates.                             
        The Company confirms that where information has been sourced from a third party, such information has been accurately
        reproduced and that as far as the Company is aware and is able to ascertain from information published by that third
        party, no facts have been omitted that would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Where
        information sourced from third parties has been presented, the source of such information has been identified. The
        Company does not intend, and does not assume any obligations to update industry or market data set forth in this
        Prospectus.                                                               
        Industry publications or reports generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources
        believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. The Company has not

Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        revenue growth from such customers, demonstrated by a 111% Revenue Net Retention Rate in the six months ended
        30 June 2020 and 106% in the year ended 31 December 2019.                 
                                                                                  
        11.3.6 Direct relationships with mobile network operators, OTT-providers and financial services providers
        The Group’s direct relationships with mobile network operators, OTT-providers and financial services providers have a
        significant impact on the Group’s results of operations. The Group’s ability to source certain CPaaS and payments services
        can drive demand for The Group’s services, reduce the cost of services and provide a competitive advantage in certain
        markets. The Group has generally experienced a positive correlation between the number of its direct relationships and
        growth in revenue and gross margin.                                       
        In addition, certain CPaaS services provided by the Group require direct relationships with OTT providers. The contracts
        with the OTT providers enable the Group to supplement its traditional CPaaS messaging and voice services with OTT
        communication services and offer its customers omni-channel communication capabilities, thereby providing the Group
        with a competitive advantage vis-à-vis traditional CPaaS providers. In addition, the Group’s omni-channel
        communication capabilities also allow the Group to mitigate its communication services supplier risk and manage its
        communication-related cost of services as it can shift its messaging and voice services to different communication
        channels.                                                                 
        11.3.7 Platform costs and operating expenses                              
        The Group believes that to expand its business, it needs to continue to invest in development of its products and services.
        As its products and services have been primarily built in-house, it expects to continue to make significant investments
        in research and development activities that will enable the Group not to rely significantly on any third-party systems or
        service providers to provide its products and services and, consequently, to not make significant investments in
        integrating and maintaining third-party systems or resolving legacy system issues. The Group expects to realise cost
        savings through economies of scale, but may incur costs during phases of expansion and optimisation. For information
        relating to the Group's investments reference is made to Section 11.14 "Investments".
        11.3.8 Exchange rates                                                     
        The Group undertakes business in foreign currencies and is consequently exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates.
        Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions related to operations conducted, and assets and liabilities arising in
        foreign currencies. The Group undertakes transactions denominated in NOK, SEK, DKK, EUR, GBP, BGN, CHF, RON, MKD
        and PLN. Revenue and cost transactions within foreign subsidiaries are normally carried out in the same currency, which
        mitigates the currency risk. The Group has no hedging arrangements. See Section 2.3.2 "Currency fluctuations could
        affect the Group’s cash flow and financial condition".                    
        However, as the Group's overall financial reporting is presented in NOK, changes in the value of SEK, DKK, EUR, GBP,
        BGN, CHF, RON, MKD or PLN in relation to NOK affect the Group’s overall revenue, profit or loss and financial position.
        Based on exposure throughout the year and balances at the period-end, the Group assesses that fluctuations in
        NOK/EUR, NOK/DKK and NOK/SEK have the most significant impact on the financial reporting of financial assets and
        liabilities.                                                              
        For the year ended 31 December 2019, 80% of the Group’s revenue were generated in a currency other than the NOK.
        Based on exposure throughout the year and balances at the period-end, the Group assesses that fluctuations in
        NOK/EUR, NOK/DKK and NOK/SEK have the most significant impact on the financial reporting of financial assets and
        liabilities.                                                              
        The table below summarises the impact a change in these currencies will have on the consolidated income statement
        and on retained earnings/accumulated losses as of 30 June 2020. The analysis is based on the assumption that the
        foreign exchange rates increase or decrease by 10%, all other variables held constant.

Link Mobility Group Holding ASA - Prospectus          
                                                                                  
        comparable in the second half of 2019 for Denmark, while Finland had a soft start to 2020 and management has assumed
        a pick-up in growth rates late in 2020.                                   
                                                                                  
        Gross Margin assumptions: Management assumes fairly stable margins overall for the full year in the region with normal
        seasonality with lower margins in the fourth quarter of 2020, as a higher portion of the volume derives from high volume
        but lower margin customers due to campaigns in connection with the Christmas season. Management assumes Gross
        Margin to be slightly reduced for the year ending 31 December 2020 as a result of customer mix as high volume but
        lower margin customers constituting a larger portion of the growth in volumes and thereby diluting margins slightly. The
        negative effect on gross margin from customer mix outweighs the increased margins from positive product mix.
        Central region                                                            
        Revenue assumptions: Overall growth rates for the region are assumed to decrease in the second half compared to first
        half of 2020 as the acquisition of the TeraComm Group in August 2019 becomes part of the organic footprint while
        underlying business excluding acquisitions is expected to maintain a stable growth rate in line with the year ended
        31 December 2019. The revenue momentum in Germany is strongly linked to industries like logistics and e-commerce
        which experience a volume increase from COVID-19. Management also expects a rebound in messaging volumes and
        activity in markets like Bulgaria, Romania and Poland although recovery has been slower than for the Western Europe
        region. Management has forecasted lower mobile payments revenue in Bulgaria and Romania for the remaining months
        in 2020 due to COVID-19. Due to the revenue streams in Bulgaria and Romania, lower gross margin will have limited
        impact on Group’s profitability.                                          
        Gross Margin assumptions: Management assumes gross margin will remain stable compared to the financial year ended
        31 December 2019 based on current trends. Stabilisation of Germany’s gross margin through the second quarter 2020
        has been key to set an assumption of stable margin development.           
        Western region                                                            
        Revenues assumptions: Overall growth rate for the region is assumed to decline from the 21% level in the first half of
        2020 as Spot-Hit becomes part of the organic footprint. The outlook assumes continued fairly open societies in countries
        which were mostly impacted by severe lockdown measures during the first half of 2020 (Italy, France and Spain). The
        assumed growth rates for second half of 2020 are in line with reported growth rates before COVID-19 negatively
        impacted growth rates from April.                                         
        Gross Margin assumptions: Overall management assumes stable margin development in the region with a margin decline
        in entities like Netmessage and Spot Hit from customer mix and quality measures. In entities like Spain and Netsize
        management has assumed expanded margins from healthier customer and country mix and new products.
        Global messaging                                                          
        Revenue assumptions: Growth rates on global messaging are assumed to decline in the second half of 2020 primarily
        due to lower aggregator revenue. The Group observes that volume thresholds that enable discounts from the mobile
        operators on certain destinations will be met to a larger extent compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019
        by enterprise traffic, thus resulting in reduced aggregator volumes. The reduction on aggregator volumes will have close
        to zero impact on gross margin, as the profitability is very low for the relevant destinations. The Group expects to
        continue to experience healthy growth in their Global Enterprises business through expansion of their business to new
        destinations for P2A messaging volumes. Growth rates can be volatile in global messaging while gross margin sensitivity
        is limited due to the lower margin level, especially for aggregator customers.
        Gross Margin assumptions: Gross margin is assumed to slightly decline for the year ending 31 December 2020 compared
        to the financial year ended 31 December 2019. The decline is mainly driven by the highly competitive aggregator
        landscape with competition pushing traffic at a loss margin, especially during the second quarter of 2020. As the Group
        moves away from the most competitive routes, management expects Gross Margins to improve during the second half
        of 2020.

        The Group’s total revenue for the year ending 31 December 2020 is forecasted to be in the range of NOK 3,500 – 3,600
        million.

        The Group’s total Gross Margin for the year ending 31 December 2020 is forecasted in the range 24.2% – 24.7% of total
        revenues.

        For the year ending 31 December 2020, the Group forecasts the Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of NOK 360 million
        – NOK 370 million.                                                        
        6 For the purpose of this Section 11.4.8, Adjusted EBITDA is derived from operating profit (loss) and defined as operating profit (loss)
        added back depreciation and amortization and adjusted for M&A activities costs and restructuring costs and other. M&A activities costs
        are mainly related to consultant and legal advisors expenses incurred in connection with acquisition of subsidiaries. Restructuring costs
        and other are mainly related to (i) efficiency projects, start-up costs for new businesses and branding/rebranding costs in connection with
        the acquisition of subsidiaries and (ii) severance paid to certain employees as a result of acquisition of subsidiaries and changes in the
        Group’s strategic focus also including certain replacement/rehiring cost. See also Section 4.2.3 "Non-IFRS financial measures".

        Revenue was NOK 1,972.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 compared to NOK 1,294.0 million for the
        year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 52.4%. This increase was primarily as a result of organic
        growth and acquisitions during the year 2018. The organic growth was driven by the expansion of the Group’s
        customer base and stable revenue intake from the existing customers and the integration of the Global Messaging
        segment, which was acquired in 2018, to the Group’s operations. This growth is also partly as a result of the
        introduction of new products such as Link Conversations, Link Data Insight and RCS in 2018. The revenue growth in
        the year ended 30 December 2018 was partially offset by costs and lower volumes related to GDPR
        compliance and data protection related adjustments.                       
        For the year ended 31 December 2018, Like-for-Like Revenue was NOK 1.4 billion (equal to 72.3% of the revenue for
        such period) compared to NOK 810.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 (equal to 62.6% of the revenue for
        such period) See 4.2.3 "General information - Presentation of financial and other information - Non-IFRS financial
        measures".                                                                
        In the Nordics, the revenue was NOK 915.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 compared to NOK 802.3 million
        for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 14.1%. The increase was primarily driven by expansion of the
        customer base and stable revenue intake from the existing customers.      
        In Central Europe, the revenue was NOK 515.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 compared to NOK 345.1
        million for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 49.33%. The increase was primarily driven by the

        11.9.7 Operating profit (loss)                                            
        Primarily as a result of the factors described above, the Group's operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2018
        was NOK 29.8 million, compared to NOK 45.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2017, a decrease of 34.1%. This
        was primarily a result of the Group recording a Gross Margin of 28% and 31% for the years ended 31 December 2018
        and 2017. The lower Gross Margin is as a result of the changes in customer mix, with high volume customers, which
        pay a lower per message price, representing a higher percentage of the customer base. For the years ended 31 December
        2018 and 2017 Gross Margin for the Nordics was 33% and 36%, respectively; for Central Europe was 26% and 22%,
        respectively; for Western Europe was 30% and 20%, respectively; and for Global Messaging was 13% and not applicable
        (as it became an operating segment in 2018), respectively.

        ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 73.9%. This increase was primarily as a result of increase in foreign exchange
        gains, partially offset by a decrease in other financial income mainly due to minor decreases in interest income from
        bank deposits.

        Finance expense was NOK 149.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, compared to NOK 54.9 million for the
        year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 172.2%. This increase was primarily as a result of an increase in premium
        early settlement and expensed transaction cost in connection with the early repayment of financing arrangements in
        connection with the Group’s acquisition by LINK Pecunia. These costs also took effect in 2019.

        Primarily as a result of the factors described in Sections 11.7.8 "Finance income" and 11.7.9 "Finance expenses" above,
        the Group’s net finance expense for the year ended 31 December 2018 was NOK 134.4 million, compared to an expense
        of NOK 46.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 190.5%.

        Total income tax was NOK 23.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, compared to negative NOK 4.3 million
        for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 643.5%. The increase in income tax was mainly due to the increase
        in deferred tax in 2018.                                                  
        11.9.12 Profit (loss)                                                     
        As a result of the factors described above, the Group’s loss for the year ended 31 December 2018 was NOK 81.3 million,
        compared to a loss of NOK 5.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 1,418.7%.
        11.10 Non-IFRS financial measures and other key performance indicators    
        In assessing the performance of the Group’s business, it considers a variety of financial and operating metrics, including
        certain financial measures which are not measures of financial performance under IFRS, as adopted by the European
        Union. Such measures may not be indicative of historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive
        of future results. The Group has presented these non-IFRS measures in this Prospectus because it considers them an
        important supplemental measure of its performance and believes that they are widely used by investors in comparing
        performance between companies.

         5 The following table reconciles Like-for-Like Revenue to revenue for the relevant periods:
                                                   Six months ended Year ended    
                                                     30 June     31 December      
           (In NOK million)

           Revenue .................................................................................................................. 1,717.6 1,336.1 2,932.7 1,972.0 1,294.0
           Acquisition Revenue(a) ............................................................................................... -104.0 -370.8 -803.9 -584.1 -38.6
           Like-for-Like Revenue(b) ............................................................................................. 1,613.6 965.3 2,128.7 1,387.9 1,255.4
            (a) Acquisition Revenue is defined as revenue generated by the acquired entities for the periods indicated. The Company considers Acquisition
                Revenue any revenue generated by acquired entities for four full consecutive quarters after complete ownership by the Company of such
                entity. From 1 January 2018 an acquired Spanish entity was merged with an existing entity, hence the allocation of revenues between organic
                and acquired revenue is based on a management estimate. In 2017 an acquired Danish entity was merged with an existing Danish entity,
                hence the allocation between organic and acquired revenue is estimated. See Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions".
            (b) When comparing the Like-for-Like Revenue for a relevant period, the entities used for such calculation differ from period to period, as the
                Company excludes revenues from companies acquired during the relevant periods in calculating Like-for-Like Revenue. This methodology
                allows the Company to isolate and compare the revenue generated by the companies that were operating for the full relevant period compared.
                See Section 11.3.2 "Acquisitions".                                
                When comparing the years ended 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2019, the Company excludes revenues from companies acquired in
                2019 and 2018, but includes the revenue from companies acquired in 2017, as the Company no longer considers such revenue as Acquisition
                Revenue. The growth rate of Like-for-Like Revenue for the years ended 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2019 increased from 1,956.9 to
                2,128.7, an increase of 9%.                                       
                When comparing the years ended 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2018, the Company excludes revenues from companies acquired in
                2017 and 2018. The growth rate of Like-for-Like Revenue for the years ended 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2018 increased from
                1,255.4 to 1,387.9, an increase of 11%.                           
         6 Gross Profit Conversion is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Gross Profit.
         7 Revenue Net Retention Rate is defined as revenue from the net of upsale, downsale and churn for customers throughout the period, not taking into
           account new customers during the year. Revenue Net Retention Rate excludes the acquisitions of TeraComm Group and Spothit. Excluding Spain, these
           figures are 116% and 111% for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and as of 31 December 2020, respectively. The data required to calculate these
           measures was not yet monitored in the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 and as a result comparatives for the years ended 31 December 2017
           and 2018 are not available.                                            
         8 Churn Rate is defined as revenue of customers that were a customer in the prior period but were not a customer at the beginning of the current period
           divided by the total revenue of the prior period. The data required to calculate these measures was not yet monitored in the years ended 31 December
           2017 and 2018 and as a result comparatives for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 are not available.
         9 Net Customer Expansion Rate is defined as the revenue generated from customers at the end of the period with their corresponding revenue from the
           same period in the previous year.                                      
        11.11 Liquidity and capital resources                                     
              1Introduction                                                       
        The Group manages its financing structure and cash flow requirements in response to the Group’s strategy and
        objectives, deploying financial and other resources related to those objectives.
        As of the date of this Prospectus, the Group has available cash resources amounting to approximately NOK 515 million.
        The Group currently has undrawn credit facilities in an amount of NOK 9 million. The Group holds cash in in the following
        currencies: BGN, CHF, DKK, EUR, GBP, HUF, MKD, NOK, PLN, RON, SEK and USD.
        The Group’s liquidity requirements arise primarily from the need to fund working capital and capital expenditures for the
        expansion, maintenance and refurbishment of the Group’s information technology and other assets, as well as to make
        acquisitions and realise potential growth and cost-saving opportunities from acquisitions and related synergies.
        The Group's main source of liquidity are primarily through financing arrangements, revenues from operating activities
        and cash and cash equivalents.                                            
        The Group may also dispose of non-core businesses or enter into joint ventures or other partnerships that would generate
        cash. The Group’s future financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, many of which are not foreseeable.
        The Group assesses capital on the basis of a leverage ratio as shown in the table below on an as adjusted basis as of
        the date of the Prospectus (prior to Adjustments subject to the Offering and Listing). Please also refer to Section 9
